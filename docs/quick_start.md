# More Quick Start Questions

Input your research question or problem statement: `python3 -m curie.main -q "<Your research question>"`.

## **Example 1**: Understand the sorting algorithm efficiency.

```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
  -q "How does the choice of sorting algorithm impact runtime performance across different \
  input distributions (random, nearly sorted, reverse sorted)?"
``` 
- **Estimated runtime**: ~5 minutes
- **Sample log file**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/research_sorting_efficiency_20250306.log)
- **Experiment report**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/research_sorting_efficiency_20250306_report.md).
- **Log monitoring**:
  - Real-time logs are streamed to the console.
  - Logs are also stored in:
    - `logs/research_question_<ID>.log` 
    - `logs/research_question_<ID>_verbose.log`.
- **Reproducibility**: The full experimentation process is saved in `workspace/research_<ID>/`.


## **Example 2**: Find good ML strategies for noisy data.

```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
  -q "Are ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) more robust to added noise \
  in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset compared to linear models like Logistic Regression \
  for a binary classification task?"
```

- **Estimated runtime**: <5 minutes
- **Estimated cost**: $0.55

<!-- 
## **Example 3**: Optimize feature selection for classification tasks.
- *Basic question*: whether feature selection helps the model performace.
```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
  -q "In the Wine dataset (which classifies wine cultivars based on chemical properties), \
  does using a genetic algorithm for feature selection improve model classification performance \
  in terms of accuracy when compared to using the full feature set? Specifically, does combining \
  the selected features with an ensemble classifier (e.g., Random Forest) lead to higher accuracy?"
```

- *More advanced question*: Find the optimal feature selection.

```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
  -q "For the Wine dataset (identifying wine cultivars using chemical properties), when using \ 
  an ensemble classifier (e.g., Random Forest), what is the best subset of features that will create a simpler, \
  more interpretable model that outperforms models  built on the full feature set. "
``` -->

## Expample 3: Evaluating CNN Performance on MNIST with Varying Batch Sizes (GPU Preferred)

```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
-q "How does the batch size affect model performance on the MNIST dataset, in terms of test accuracy and training speed? \
Setup: \
Please use PyTorch to code and GPU to train models. \
Use a CNN with 2 convolutional layers: each layer has 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation, followed by a 2x2 max-pooling layer. \
Then flatten and connect to a fully connected layer for classification. \
Evaluate the model using different batch sizes: 16, 64, 128, and 256. \
Training Details: \
Use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. \
Train each model for 10 epochs. \
Use the standard MNIST train/test split (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images). \
Metrics: \
Record the test accuracy after training. \
Measure the average training time per epoch (in seconds)." --report
