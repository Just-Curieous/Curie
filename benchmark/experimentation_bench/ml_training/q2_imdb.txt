Task description:
Perform sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews to classify the text as positive or negative. Your goal is get the best prediction accuracy possible.

Instructions:
- Checkout the code dependency and set up the environment:
```
cd /starter_file/MLAgentBench
pip install -e .
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y -q
pip install -q -r requirements.txt
```

- Install Kaggle
```
export KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR=/starter_file/MLAgentBench/MLAgentBench/.kaggle
pip install kaggle
sudo apt-get install unzip -y
```

- Refer to the benchmark question under `MLAgentBench/benchmarks/imdb/`.
```
cd MLAgentBench/benchmarks/imdb
```

Here is your task:
- Modify the provided env/train.py script to train a model on cpu and experimenting with different models or feature selections to improve accuracy. 
You MUST "cat" to read the script and then modify it. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library, and `train.py` contains skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving predictions to `submission.csv`. 
Make sure to save class-wise probabilities for test set examples to `submission.csv`.
You must execute train.py by going into the env/ directory:
```
cd env
python train.py
cd .. 
```
- Evaluate the model performance via:
```
cd scripts
python eval.py
cd ..
```
- Report the training model along with its configurations that gives the best performance (accuracy).

Goal:
Identify the model and its configuration that achieve the best accuracy, and report the results.
