# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "dataset=Parkinsonâ€™s disease progression dataset (time-series data as described in env/data_description.txt)",
        "hardware=specified Docker environment with CPU or GPU setup",
        "evaluation_metric=Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) computed per UPDRS subscore and averaged"
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "model_architecture=any valid regression model or neural network architecture suitable for time-series prediction (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Transformer, fully-connected neural networks)",
        "feature_extraction=methods such as time windowing, feature selection, normalization strategies",
        "hyperparameters=any valid hyperparameters for the chosen model, e.g., learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, dropout, regularization"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "SMAPE per UPDRS subscore (updrs_0, updrs_1, updrs_2, updrs_3)",
        "overall average SMAPE across all four UPDRS subscores"
    ]
