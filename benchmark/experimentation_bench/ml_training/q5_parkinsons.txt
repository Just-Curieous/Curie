Task description:
Parkinsons-disease is a regression task predicting the progression of Parkinsonâ€™s disease from time-series data. Modify the code in the `env/train.py` script to perform this task.

Here is your task:
- Go through the `env/data_description.txt` file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do. 
```

# -------------------------------------
# Docker Setup (Recommended)
# -------------------------------------

# 1. Pull the pre-built Docker image:
docker pull qhwang123/researchassistant:latest

# 2. Run the container with necessary mounts:
# Without GPU:
docker run -it --user root -v "$(pwd)":/MLAgentBench -w /MLAgentBench qhwang123/researchassistant:latest

# With GPU:
docker run -it --user root --gpus all -v "$(pwd)":/MLAgentBench -w /MLAgentBench qhwang123/researchassistant:latest

# 3. Install dependencies inside the container:
apt update && apt install -y wget unzip

# 4. Configure Kaggle API Key:
# Install Kaggle CLI and configure API key inside the Docker container
pip install kaggle

# Ensure the Kaggle config directory exists
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle

# Copy the Kaggle API key from the mounted host directory
cp /starter_file/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# Set the correct permissions for security
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# 5. Prepare the amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction task:
python -u -m MLAgentBench.prepare_task amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction

# 6. Train the model:
cd starter_file/MLAgentBench/MLAgentBench/benchmarks/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/env
python train.py

Goal: 
Identify the model and its configuration that achieve the best performance, and report the results. Make sure to report the SMAPE score for each configuration as well.
