Task description:
Parkinsons-disease is a regression task predicting the progression of Parkinsonâ€™s disease from time-series data. Modify the code in the `env/train.py` script to perform this task.

Instructions:
- Checkout the code dependency and set up the environment:
```
cd /starter_file/MLAgentBench
pip install -e .
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y -q
pip install -q -r requirements.txt
```

- Install Kaggle
```
export KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR=/starter_file/MLAgentBench/MLAgentBench/.kaggle
pip install kaggle
sudo apt-get install unzip -y
```

- Refer to the benchmark question under `MLAgentBench/benchmarks/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/`.
```
cd MLAgentBench/benchmarks/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction
```

Here is your task:
- Go through the `env/data_description.txt` file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do. Prepare the dataset using `env/prepare.py`.
```
cd scripts
python prepare.py
cd ..
```
- Then fill in the provided `env/train.py` script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). You should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the `env/evaluation_details.txt` file. You must execute it by going into the env/ directory:
```
cd env
python train.py
cd .. 
```

- Finally, evaluate the model performance via:
```
cd scripts
python eval.py
cd ..
```

Goal: 
Identify the model and its configuration that achieve the best performance, and report the results. Make sure to report the SMAPE score for each configuration as well.
