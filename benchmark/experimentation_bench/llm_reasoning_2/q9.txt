Question:
How does the position of an incorrect step within the reasoning chain affect the overall outcome? Is an early error more detrimental than a later one?

The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials:
```
source /curie/setup/env.sh
```
2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```
3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
    - Set the args.method to auto_cot
    - Set the args.model to gpt-4o-mini
    - Set the args.dataset to test 1 dataset: gsm8k 
    - Example command:
```
python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_3 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_3  > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_3.log
```

4. Use demo files:
   - The modified demos for `gsm8k` are already available:
     - **Early errors:** `demo/gsm8k_early`
     - **Later errors:** `demo/gsm8k_later`

5. Run inference for each demo:
   - Test the accuracy for the demos with early and later errors using the following commands:

python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_early --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_early > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_early.log 
python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_later --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_later > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_later.log


6. Analyze accuracy:
   - Review the log files generated in the `log/` directory. The accuracy is reported at the end of each file:
     - `log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_early.log` (for early errors).
     - `log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_later.log` (for later errors).
   - Record and compare the accuracy for the two cases.

7. Draw conclusions:
   - Summarize your findings:
     - Dataset name: `gsm8k`.
     - Accuracy with early errors: Report from `log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_early.log`.
     - Accuracy with later errors: Report from `log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_later.log`.
   - Discuss how the position of an error affects the modelâ€™s performance:
     - Does an early error disrupt the logical flow more than a later error?
     - How much does the position of the error impact overall accuracy?
