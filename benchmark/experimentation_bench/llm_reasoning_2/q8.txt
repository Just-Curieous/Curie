What is the relationship between the complexity of a task (i.e., as measured by the number of logical inferences or mathematical operations needed) and the optimal length of the reasoning chain?

Additional details:
- Use GPT-4o-mini as the model.
- Use the gsm8k and last_letters datasets.
- Use the Auto-CoT method for increasing number of reasoning steps.
