Question:
How do different methods of expanding reasoning steps (e.g., repeating the question, self-verification, making equations) affect the model's accuracy, and are some expansion strategies more effective than others?

The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials:
```
source /exp_agent/setup/env.sh
```
2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```
3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
    - Set the args.method to auto_cot
    - Set the args.model to gpt-4o-mini
    - Set the args.dataset to test 1 dataset: gsm8k 
    - Example command:
```
python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_1 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_1  > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_1.log
```

4. Use pre-existing demo files:
   - The demo files for different reasoning expansion strategies are already available in the `demo` directory. For example:
     - Repeating the question: `demo/gsm8k_readquestion`
     - Self-verification: `demo/gsm8k_selfverification`
     - Making equations: `demo/gsm8k_makeequations`
     - Think about words: `demo/gsm8k_thinkaboutwords`
   - Choose the relevant demo files for the dataset and strategy.

5. Run inference for each demo:
   - Test the accuracy for each reasoning strategy:
   - Example command:

python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_selfverification --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_selfverification > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_selfverification.log

   - Replace `gsm8k_selfverification` with the appropriate demo file for each reasoning strategy.

6. Compare accuracy:
   - Review the log files generated in the `log/` directory. The accuracy is reported at the end of each file (e.g., `log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_selfverification.log`).
   - Collect the accuracy for each strategy.

7. Report findings:
   - For each dataset and reasoning expansion strategy, summarize the results:
     - Dataset name.
     - Expansion strategy used (e.g., repeating the question, self-verification).
     - Log file with accuracy.
     - Observed accuracy.

8. Draw conclusions:
   - Analyze which expansion strategy was most effective for improving accuracy.
   - Discuss any trade-offs observed (e.g., reasoning complexity vs. accuracy gains).
