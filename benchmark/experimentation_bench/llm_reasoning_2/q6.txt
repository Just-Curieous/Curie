Question:
Does the optimal number of reasoning steps vary across different LLMs (i.e., gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4o), and if so, what is the nature of this relationship? Your task is to determine the optimal reasoning step count for each model using the `last_letters` dataset.

The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials:
```
source /curie/setup/env.sh
```
2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```

3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
    - Set the args.method to auto_cot
    - Set the args.dataset to test 1 dataset:last_letters
    - Example command:
```
python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demo/last_letters_3 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_3  > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_3.log #3 represent the number of add step, last_letters is the name of the dataset
```

4. Test with **gpt-4o-mini**:
   You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
   - Set the following parameters:
     - `args.method`: `auto_cot`
     - `args.model`: `gpt-4o-mini`
   - Optional: Increase `args.max_length_cot` to accommodate longer reasoning steps if necessary.
   - Example command to run inference:

python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demos/last_letters_1 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1 > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1.log

   - Replace `last_letters_1` with the appropriate demo file for testing different reasoning steps. The number in the demo name (e.g., `1`) corresponds to the number of reasoning steps added.

- Execute these within the directory `/starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models`. This will ensure you don't face file path errors when running the commands above.
- Here are the demos available (you don't need to test all of them, just what makes sense): 
last_letters_1
last_letters_10
last_letters_2
last_letters_3
last_letters_4
last_letters_5
last_letters_6

5. Test with **gpt-4o**:
   - Modify `run_inference.py` again, and set the following parameters:
     - `args.method`: `auto_cot`
     - `args.model`: `gpt-4o`
   - Run inference for `gpt-4o` with varying reasoning steps. 
   - Example command:

python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demos/last_letters_1 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o/last_letters_1 > log/gpt-4o/last_letters_1.log
- Replace `last_letters_1` with the appropriate demo file for testing different reasoning steps.

- Execute these within the directory `/starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models`. This will ensure you don't face file path errors when running the commands above.
- Here are the demos available (you don't need to test all of them, just what makes sense): 
last_letters_1
last_letters_10
last_letters_2
last_letters_3
last_letters_4
last_letters_5
last_letters_6

6. Determine the optimal reasoning steps for **gpt-4o-mini**:
   - Review the log files generated in the `log/` directory. The accuracy is reported at the end of each file (e.g., `log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1.log`).
   - Identify the demo file that achieved the **highest accuracy** (e.g., `demos/last_letters_3`).
   - Open the demo file and count the number of reasoning steps in the rationale section:
     - Exclude the first sentence, such as "Letâ€™s think step by step."
     - Exclude the last sentence indicating the final answer.
     - Only count intermediate steps.
   - Record the **optimal number of reasoning steps** for gpt-4o-mini.

7. Determine the optimal reasoning steps for **gpt-4o**:
   - Review the log files generated in the `log/` directory for gpt-4o (e.g., `log/gpt-4o/last_letters_1.log`).
   - Identify the demo file that achieved the **highest accuracy**.
   - Open the corresponding demo file and count the reasoning steps as described in Step 5.

8. Compare and analyze:
   - Summarize the results for both models (`gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4o`):
     - Dataset name: `last_letters`.
     - Model name: `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4o`.
     - Log file with the highest accuracy.
     - Demo file corresponding to the highest accuracy.
     - Optimal number of reasoning steps.
   - Discuss how the optimal reasoning steps differ between the models and what this implies about their reasoning capabilities and computational efficiency.
