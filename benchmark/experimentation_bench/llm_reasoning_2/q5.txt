What is the optimal number of reasoning steps for different types of tasks (i.e., mathematical reasoning tasks such as `gsm8k` or pattern recognition tasks such as `last_letters`) to maximize accuracy while minimizing computational cost (LLM API call cost)? Your task is to determine this for the above tasks.

Additional details:
- Use GPT-4o-mini as the model.
- Use the Auto-CoT method for increasing number of reasoning steps.
