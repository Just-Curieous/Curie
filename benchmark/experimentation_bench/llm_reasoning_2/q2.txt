Question: For multi-step reasoning tasks, the optimal number of reasoning steps to achieve high accuracy will vary depending on the problem type (e.g., mathematical problems and logic problems). Your task is to determine the optimal number of reasoning steps for the given datasets.

The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials: 
```
source /exp_agent/setup/env.sh
```
2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```
3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
    - Set the args.method to auto_cot
    - Set the args.model to gpt-4o-mini
    - Set the args.dataset to test 2 datasets: gsm8k and last_letters
    - Example command:
```
python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demo/last_letters_3 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_3  > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_3.log #3 represent the number of add step, last_letters is the name of the dataset
python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_3 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_3  > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_3.log
```
- Execute these within the directory `/starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models`. This will ensure you don't face file path errors when running the commands above.
- Here are the demos available (you don't need to test all of them, just what makes sense): 
gsm8k_2
gsm8k_3
gsm8k_1
last_letters_1
last_letters_2
last_letters_3

4. Identify the log file with the highest accuracy:
   a. Review log files in the `log/` directory.
   b. Locate the file with the **highest accuracy** for each dataset.
      Example:
      - `log/gsm8k_2.log`
      - `log/last_letters_3.log`

5. Find the corresponding demo file:
   a. For each log file with the highest accuracy, identify the matching demo file.
      Example:
      - If `log/gsm8k_2.log` has the highest accuracy, the demo file is `demo/gsm8k_2`.

6. Count the reasoning steps in the demo file:
   a. Open the identified demo file (e.g., `demo/gsm8k_2`) and locate the rationale section.
   b. Count the number of reasoning steps in the rationale:
      - Exclude the first sentence, such as "Letâ€™s think step by step."
      - Exclude the last sentence indicating the final answer.
      - Only count intermediate steps.

7. Report the optimal number of reasoning steps:
   a. For each dataset, record:
      - Dataset name.
      - Log file with highest accuracy.
      - Corresponding demo file.
      - Optimal number of reasoning steps.
