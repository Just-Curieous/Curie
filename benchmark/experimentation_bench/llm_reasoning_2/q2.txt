For multi-step reasoning tasks, the optimal number of reasoning steps to achieve high accuracy will vary depending on the problem type (e.g., mathematical problems and logic problems). Your task is to determine the optimal number of reasoning steps for the given datasets.

Additional details:
- Test this for the gsm8k and last_letters datasets.
- Use GPT-4o-mini as the model.
- Use the Auto-CoT method for increasing number of reasoning steps.
