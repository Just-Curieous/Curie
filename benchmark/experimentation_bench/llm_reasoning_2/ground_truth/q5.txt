# Answer:

When using gpt-4o-mini, the optimal number of reasoning steps for 
Gsm8k, is more than adding 3 steps. For Last_letters, it's adding 3 steps. Because for last_letters, the accuracy of adding 3 steps is equal to the accuracy of adding 4 steps.

# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "model=gpt-4o-mini",
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT"
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "reasoning_steps=use at least 3 reasoning steps for each dataset",
        "datasets"="gsm8k, last_letters"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy",
        "llm_api_cost: api cost for gpt-4o-mini"
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Select Datasets

Use two datasets: gsm8k and last_letters.

3. Run Experiments with Varying Reasoning Steps

Use run_inference.py with these parameters:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Datasets: gsm8k and last_letters

Systematically vary the number of reasoning steps by choosing appropriate demo files (e.g., gsm8k_1, gsm8k_2, gsm8k_3, last_letters_1, last_letters_2, last_letters_3).

Clearly save output logs for analysis.

4. Evaluate Accuracy

Review logs to extract accuracy metrics, which appear at the end of each log file.

Identify the demo file and reasoning-step configuration yielding the highest accuracy for each dataset.

5. Evaluate Computational Cost

Calculate LLM API cost for the gpt-4o-mini model.

6. Report Findings

Clearly summarize for each dataset:

Dataset name.

Optimal number of reasoning steps balancing accuracy and computational cost.
