# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "model=gpt-4o-mini",
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT",
        "datasets"="last_letters"
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "reasoning_demo=use the last_letters_false demo, and some other demo with arbitrary reasoning steps"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy"
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Run Experiments with Auto-CoT

Use run_inference.py with these parameters:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Dataset: last_letters

Conduct experiments using two types of demos:

Incorrect reasoning demo: Contains deliberate errors in intermediate reasoning steps and an incorrect final answer (i.e., last_letters_false).

Correct reasoning demo: Contains accurate intermediate reasoning steps and a correct final answer (e.g., last_letters_6).

Optional: Adjust args.max_length_cot if necessary to accommodate longer reasoning outputs.

3. Evaluate Accuracy

For each condition, run inference and clearly record accuracy from the logs.

Accuracy is the proportion of correctly solved problems on the dataset.

4. Analyze and Compare Results

Compare accuracy between:

The demo with incorrect reasoning (last_letters_false).

The demo with correct reasoning (e.g., last_letters_6).

Assess how errors in intermediate reasoning influence final accuracy.

5. Summarize Findings

Clearly summarize the differences in accuracy.

Provide examples illustrating how the model's outputs and behaviors differ between conditions with correct vs. incorrect intermediate reasoning.
