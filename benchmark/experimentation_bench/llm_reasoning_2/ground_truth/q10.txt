# Answer:

Comparing gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini, GPT-4o exhibits a higher level of optimal accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini, making it more reliable for tasks that demand precision and correctness in output, even when we increasing the number of reasoning steps for gpt-4o to the max provided, for this task.

# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT",
        "datasets"="gsm8k",
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "model=gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o",
        "reasoning_steps=use all reasoning steps for the gsm8k task, i.e., 1,2,3 steps"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy",
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Select Dataset

Use the dataset: gsm8k.

3. Run Experiments for GPT-4o-mini

Run inference using run_inference.py with:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Systematically vary the number of reasoning steps by choosing appropriate demo files (e.g., gsm8k_1, gsm8k_2, gsm8k_3).

Clearly save outputs and log files.

4. Run Experiments for GPT-4o

Repeat inference using:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o

Similarly vary reasoning steps with provided demo files.

Save outputs and logs clearly.

5. Evaluate Accuracy

Extract accuracy metrics from the log files.

Identify pairs of log files (one from each model) where the accuracies achieved are similar.

6. Analyze and Summarize Findings

For each comparable accuracy scenario, summarize:

Dataset (gsm8k)

Achieved accuracy

Number of reasoning steps for each model
