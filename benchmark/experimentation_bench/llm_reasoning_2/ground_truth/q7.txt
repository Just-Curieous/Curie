# Answer: 

Ground truth: Equations, think about words, and self-verification are better, than using repeating the question

This is an example of approximately the results you should see obtained:

Repeating the question:93.1
Self-verification:93.4
Making equations:93.5
Think about words:93.6

# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "datasets"="gsm8k"
        "model=gpt-4o-mini",
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT",
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "reasoning_expansion_methods=Repeating the question, Self-verification, Making equations, Think about words",
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy",
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Select Dataset

Use the dataset: gsm8k.

3. Run Experiments with Different Reasoning Strategies

Use run_inference.py with these fixed parameters:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

args.dataset: gsm8k

Evaluate multiple reasoning expansion strategies using provided demo files, that is:

Repeating the question (gsm8k_readquestion)

Self-verification (gsm8k_selfverification)

Making equations (gsm8k_makeequations)

Think about words (gsm8k_thinkaboutwords)

Run inference separately for each reasoning strategy and save logs clearly labeled by strategy.

4. Evaluate Accuracy

Extract accuracy from the logs generated for each reasoning strategy (accuracy reported at the end of each log).

5. Compare and Summarize Results

For each reasoning strategy, clearly summarize:

Dataset (gsm8k)

Strategy tested (e.g., repeating the question, self-verification)

Accuracy achieved

Analyze and determine which reasoning expansion strategies performed better.
