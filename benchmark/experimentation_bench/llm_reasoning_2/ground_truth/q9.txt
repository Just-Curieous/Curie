# Answer:

Early errors are more detrimental to the overall reasoning process than later errors. Early errors disrupt the logical flow more significantly, impacting the model's performance. In contrast, later errors allow the model to maintain a higher accuracy, showing less impact on overall performance.

# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT",
        "model=gpt-4o-mini",
        "datasets"="gsm8k",
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "reasoning_demo=use the gsm8k_early demo, and the gsm8k_later demo"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy",
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Select Dataset and Demos

Dataset: gsm8k (math reasoning).

Test two demo conditions that differ by error placement:

Early errors demo (gsm8k_early)

Later errors demo (gsm8k_later)

3. Run Experiments

Use run_inference.py with the following parameters:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Vary args.demo_path to use each demo condition (gsm8k_early, gsm8k_later).

Save inference outputs and logs clearly labeled by error condition.

4. Evaluate Accuracy

Review accuracy from log files for each condition (accuracy reported at the end of each log).

5. Analyze Results

Summarize results clearly, noting:

Dataset (gsm8k)

Accuracy for demo with early errors

Accuracy for demo with later errors

6. Draw Conclusions

Discuss how error position affects model performance:

Is the impact on accuracy greater when errors occur earlier versus later in reasoning?
