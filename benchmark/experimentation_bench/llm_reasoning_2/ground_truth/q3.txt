# Answer:

Adding more steps in reasoning will increase the accuracy, both for auto_cot and zero_shot_cot.

# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "model=gpt-4o-mini",
        "datasets"="last_letters"
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "reasoning_steps=use at least 3 reasoning steps for Auto-CoT, and the two prompts mentioned in the question for Zero-shot-CoT",
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy"
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Run Experiments for Auto-CoT

Use run_inference.py with the following configurations:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Dataset: last_letters

Systematically vary the number of reasoning steps by selecting different demo files that represent different step counts.

Clearly save outputs and logs for each experiment.

3. Run Experiments for Zero-shot-CoT

Run run_inference.py with these parameters:

args.method: zero_shot_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Dataset: last_letters

Conduct two conditions:

Original condition: Use the default prompt ("Let's think step by step.").

Modified condition: Update the prompt (args.cot_trigger) to explicitly request additional reasoning (e.g., "Let's think step by step. You must think more steps.").

Save outputs and logs separately.

4. Evaluate Results

Extract accuracy metrics from the logs for each experiment configuration.

Accuracy is the proportion of correctly solved questions.

5. Analyze and Report

Compare accuracy across:

Different reasoning-step counts for Auto-CoT.

Original versus modified prompting in Zero-shot-CoT.

Summarize your findings clearly, noting the dataset, demo conditions, and observed accuracy differences.
