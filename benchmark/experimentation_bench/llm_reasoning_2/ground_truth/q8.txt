# Answer:

More complex tasks with higher logical and mathematical operations required more reasoning steps, whereas simpler pattern recognition tasks required fewer steps before performance declined.

Correctly identify gsm8k as the more complex task among the two.

gsm8k`: Optimal steps are seen in `gsm8k_3`.
`last_letters`: Optimal steps are seen starting in `last_letters_2`, `last_letters_3`, `last_letters_4`.
