# Answer:

The optimal number of reasoning steps vary across different LLMs. For larger model, adding more steps seems to have a higher upperbound for accuracy.

For Last_letters:
Gpt-4o-mini: add 3 steps
Gpt-4o: add 4 steps

# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "method for increasing reasoning_steps=Auto-CoT",
        "datasets"="last_letters"
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "reasoning_steps=use at least 3 reasoning steps for each dataset",
        "model=gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o",
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "accuracy",
    ],
}

# Setup:

1. Environment Preparation

Ensure your Python environment and dependencies are correctly configured according to repository documentation in https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

2. Select Dataset

Use the dataset: last_letters.

3. Run Experiments for GPT-4o-mini

Run inference using run_inference.py with parameters:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o-mini

Systematically vary the number of reasoning steps by choosing appropriate demo files (e.g., last_letters_1, last_letters_2, ..., last_letters_6).

Clearly save the outputs and log files separately.

4. Run Experiments for GPT-4o

Run inference again using run_inference.py, changing:

args.method: auto_cot

args.model: gpt-4o

Similarly, vary the reasoning steps with corresponding demo files.

Clearly save outputs and logs separately.

5. Evaluate Accuracy

Review accuracy metrics recorded in each log file.

Identify the demo file achieving the highest accuracy for each model.

6. Analyze and Summarize Results

Summarize clearly for each model (gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4o):

Dataset: last_letters

Highest accuracy achieved

Optimal number of reasoning steps

Compare and discuss differences between the two models' optimal reasoning steps.
