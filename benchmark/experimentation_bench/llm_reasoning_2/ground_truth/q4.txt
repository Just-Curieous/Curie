# Answer:

In tasks with process oriented steps, a minor error in one step may have little impact on overall performance. As we use the examples with incorrect steps, the effect of an incorrect step on overall accuracy is limited. As seen with the Last letter dataset, the impact we observed through a test run would look something like this:

False accuracy: 89.4
Correct accuracy: 93.2
