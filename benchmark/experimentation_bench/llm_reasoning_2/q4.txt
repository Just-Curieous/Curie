How does the impact of an incorrect step on overall LLM performance affect process-oriented tasks? 

Additional details:
- A minor error in one step may have little impact on overall performance, or may lead to significant deterioration in performance. Your task is to analyze this behavior using controlled experiments.
- Test this for the last_letters dataset, which will be our process-oriented task.
- Use GPT-4o-mini as the model.
- Use the Auto-CoT method for increasing number of reasoning steps.
