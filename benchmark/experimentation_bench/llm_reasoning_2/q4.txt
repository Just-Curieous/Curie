Question:
The impact of an incorrect step on the overall performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) is task-dependent (e.g., process-oriented steps, or symbolic reasoning tasks). A minor error in one step may have little impact on overall performance, or may lead to significant deterioration in performance. Your task is to analyze this behavior using controlled experiments.


The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials:
```
source /exp_agent/setup/env.sh
```
2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```

3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
    - Set the args.method to auto_cot
    - Set the args.model to gpt-4o-mini
    - Set the args.dataset to test 1 dataset: last_letters
   - Optional: Increase `args.max_length_cot` to accommodate longer reasoning steps.

4. Use the `last_letters` dataset and select the demo:
   - Use the dataset `last_letters` for this task.
   - For testing reasoning steps with errors, use the existing demo file `demo/last_letters_false`. The reasoning steps demo file without errors is called `demo/last_letters_6`.
     - This demo contains intentional errors in reasoning steps and an incorrect final answer.

5. Test the accuracy with the “false” demo:
   - Run inference on the `last_letters_false` demo. Example command:

python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demo/last_letters_false --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_false > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_false.log


6. Test the accuracy with the “right” demo:
   - Run inference on the correct demo for comparison. Example command:

python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demo/last_letters_6 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_right > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_right.log


7. Analyze and compare:
   - Review the accuracy reported at the end of each log file:
     - `log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_false.log` for the false demo.
     - `log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_right.log` for the right demo.
   - Compare the model's performance when using:
     - The demo with errors in reasoning steps (`last_letters_false`).
     - The correct demo (`last_letters_6`).

8. Report your findings:
   - Summarize the accuracy results for the `last_letters` dataset.
   - Discuss how errors in intermediate reasoning steps affect the overall performance for process-oriented tasks like `last_letters`.
   - Provide examples to illustrate the difference in model behavior with correct versus incorrect reasoning steps.
