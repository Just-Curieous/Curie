Question: Will increasing the number of reasoning steps in a Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt lead to higher accuracy in gpt-4o-mini up to a saturation point? Test this for the gsm8k and last_letters datasets.

The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials: 
```
source /curie/setup/env.sh
```

2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```

3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via cat first so you understand its contents.
    - Set the args.method to auto_cot
    - Set the args.model to gpt-4o-mini
    - Set the args.dataset to test 2 datasets: gsm8k and last_letters
    - Example command:
```
python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demo/last_letters_3 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_3  > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_3.log #1 represent the number of add step, last_letters is the name of the dataset

python run_inference.py --dataset gsm8k --demo_path demo/gsm8k_1 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_1  > log/gpt-4o-mini/gsm8k_1.log
```
- Execute these within the directory `/starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models`. This will ensure you don't face file path errors when running the commands above.
- Here are the demos available (you don't need to test all of them, just what makes sense): 
gsm8k_2
gsm8k_3
gsm8k_1
last_letters_1
last_letters_10
last_letters_2
last_letters_3
last_letters_4
last_letters_5
last_letters_6

4. Call run_inference.py with increasing number of reasoning steps. You can change the reasoning steps using different demo. In the above examples, last_letters_3 refers to add 3 reasoning steps, while last_letters_1 would refer to add 1 reasoning step. 

Optional: You can increase the args.max_length_cot in case the output of the model is truncated, and you need to view all of it. This may be useful when increasing the steps of cot.

5. The accuracy is at the end of printed log file.
