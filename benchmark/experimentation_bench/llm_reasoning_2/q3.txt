Question:
The implementation of different prompting methods, i.e., Zero-shot-Cot and Auto-CoT, and their impact on accuracy can be systematically analyzed by varying the number of reasoning steps without introducing new content. This can be achieved in a controlled experiment by adding sentences that restate the question to increase reasoning steps. We will be using the last_letters dataset for this task.

The code you need is available in /starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Instructions:
1. Set OpenAI credentials: 
```
source /curiesetup/env.sh
```
2. Activate conda environment:
```
conda activate impact
```

3. You will call `run_inference.py` with the following parameters. Make sure to read `run_inference.py` via `cat` first so you understand its contents.
   - For **Auto-CoT**:
      - Set `args.method` to `auto_cot`.
      - Set `args.model` to `gpt-4o-mini`.
   - Example command for Auto-CoT:
   python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --demo_path demo/last_letters_1 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1 > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1.log # 1 represents the number of added steps; last_letters is the dataset name

- Execute these within the directory `/starter_file/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models`. This will ensure you don't face file path errors when running the commands above.
- Here are the demos available (you don't need to test all of them, just what makes sense): 
last_letters_1
last_letters_2
last_letters_3
last_letters_4

4. For Auto-CoT, vary the number of reasoning steps:
   - Change the reasoning steps using different demos.
   - Compare the accuracy with different reasoning step counts. For example:
     - Demo file: `demo/last_letters_1` for 1 step
     - Demo file: `demo/last_letters_3` for 3 steps

5. For **Zero-shot-CoT**:
   - Set `args.method` to `zero_shot_cot`.
   - Use the original demo for testing. For example:
     - The demo for `last_letters` is located at `demo/last_letters_1`.

6. Modify Zero-shot-CoT by adding a sentence:
   - Modify `args.cot_trigger` in `run_inference.py` to be: "Letâ€™s think step by step. You must think more steps". This is asking the model to think more steps, since the default `args.cot_trigger` value is just "Let's think step by step.".

Your task: 
1. Test and compare for Zero-shot-CoT:
   - Run the experiment with the original demo for Zero-shot-CoT (without modification) in Instructions step 5 above.
   - Then, test with the modified `args.cot_trigger` version in Instructions step 6 above.
   - Example command for Zero-shot-CoT:
   python run_inference.py --dataset last_letters --method zero_shot_cot --demo_path demo/last_letters_1 --output_dir experiment/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1 > log/gpt-4o-mini/last_letters_1.log # 1 represents the number of added steps; last_letters is the dataset name
2. Test and compare for Auto-CoT:
   - Run the experiment repeatedly with different reasoning steps, as in Instructions step 3 and 4 above. 

2. Analyze and report:
   - Compare the accuracy between:
     - Different reasoning step counts in Auto-CoT.
     - Zero-shot-CoT, with and without the modified `args.cot_trigger` sentence.
   - Summarize your findings, specifying the dataset, demo file, and observed changes in accuracy.
