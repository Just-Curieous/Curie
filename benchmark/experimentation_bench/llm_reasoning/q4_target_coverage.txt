To achieve 80% success rate for GSM8K task, what is the most cost-effective configuration? 
Specifically, which model (gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4o) should be used, and how many samples per question should be generated to minimize cost? You will need to test at least 4 samples sizes, and make sure to test each of the chosen samples sizes on both gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4o.
Additional details:
- Note that GPT-4o is 16 times more expensive than gpt-4o-mini for both prompt and response tokens.
- The success rate is defined as the proportion of questions correctly answered by at least one generated sample. 
- Use the GSM8K math dataset.
