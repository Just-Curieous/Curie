    "constant_vars": ["Model (gpt-4o)", "Dataset (gsm8k math)", "Number of samples 10"],
    "independent_vars": ["Temperature: sampling from 0-1"],
    "dependent_vars": ["Success rate of solving problems"]
}

# Setup:

Generation Step
Using the chosen language model (gpt-4o), generate 10 candidate responses for each question in the dataset (GSM8K math). Vary the sampling temperature from 0 to 1.

Evaluation Step
Evaluate the correctness of the generated responses. This will typically require extracting numerical answers from each generated solution using regular expressions (e.g., matching patterns like #### <answer>), normalizing answers by removing irrelevant characters such as commas, dollar signs, and trailing punctuation to ensure consistent comparisons. Record results separately from the generation outputs.

Result Analysis
Examine the evaluation results to identify whether each question is solved successfully, defined as having at least one correct response among all samples. Compute the overall success rate (proportion of successfully solved problems) for each configuration tested.
