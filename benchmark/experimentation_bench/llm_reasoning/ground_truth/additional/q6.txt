# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": ["Model (gpt-4o-mini)", "Dataset (gsm8k math)"],
    "independent_vars": ["Num_samples: at least 3 different sample counts"],
    "dependent_vars": ["Success rate of solving problems"]
}

# Setup:

Generation Step
Using the chosen language model (gpt-4o-mini), generate multiple candidate responses for each question in the dataset (GSM8K math). Vary the parameter controlling the number of generated samples per question.

Evaluation Step
Evaluate the correctness of each generated responses. This will typically require extracting numerical answers from each generated solution using regular expressions (e.g., matching patterns like #### <answer>), normalizing answers by removing irrelevant characters such as commas, dollar signs, and trailing punctuation to ensure consistent comparisons. Record results separately from the generation outputs.

Result Analysis
Examine the evaluation results to identify whether each question is solved successfully, defined as whether the answer with highest frequency is correct or not.
Compute such overall success rate (proportion of successfully solved problems) for each configuration tested.
