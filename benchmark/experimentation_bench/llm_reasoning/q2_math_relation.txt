What is the mathematical relationship between the number of generated samples (--num_samples) per question and the overall success rate? 
For instance, does the rate of success scale linearly, quadratically, or follow another pattern as the number of generated samples increases?
Additional details:
- The success rate is defined as the proportion of questions correctly answered by at least one generated sample. 
- Use the GSM8K math dataset, and the gpt-4o-mini model.
