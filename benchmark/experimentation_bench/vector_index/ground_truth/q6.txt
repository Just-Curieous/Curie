1. **Relationship Observed**: The index-building time increases with dataset size for both index types, but the extent of increase is significantly different between HNSW and IVF.
2. **Efficiency**: IVF appears to be more efficient than HNSW in terms of index-building time for the dataset sizes tested. - The IVF index-building times are significantly faster than the HNSW times, especially for larger datasets, which is consistent with the expectation that different FAISS index types have different efficiencies.
