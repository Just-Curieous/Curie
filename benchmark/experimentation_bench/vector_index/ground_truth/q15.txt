# Answer:

The HNSW index on the SIFT1M dataset consistently achieves high recall and low latency, with an error range for recall of approximately Â±0.0005, and latency per query consistently around 0.111 ms.

The determined error range for recall is approximately 0.9948 to 0.9957, and for latency, it is 0.111 to 0.114 seconds.

Check that the recall error range is approximately as above, and the latency error range is minimal as well (similar to the range above as well).
