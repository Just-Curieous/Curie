Expected result:
1. **Effect on Increasing Data Size**: Increasing data size set leads to a slightly decrease in recall.
2. **Effect on Increasing Mean**: The recall is not significantly affected by changes in the mean, showing robustness.
3. **Effect on Increasing Variance**: Higher variance leads to a decline in recall.
