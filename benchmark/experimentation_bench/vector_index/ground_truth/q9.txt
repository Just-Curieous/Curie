# Answer:

Effect of increasing efConstruction on:

- recall: Recall improves moderately during index construction.

- memory: Memory usage increases moderately during index construction.

- latency: Latency increases during index construction; minimal impact during querying.

Effect of increasing efSearch on:

- recall: Significant recall improvement during querying.

- memory: Negligible change in memory usage.

- latency: Notable increase in latency during querying.

Effect of increasing M on:

- recall: Recall improves moderately.

- memory: Significant increase in memory usage notably during both construction and querying.

- latency: Latency increases notably during both construction and querying.
