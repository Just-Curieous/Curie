Instructions: 
1. The starter file can be found under "/starter_file/faiss". Set up the environment. 
- Note: if /starter_file/faiss does not exist:
    1. If /starter_file does not exist, feel free to replace /starter_file with some other directory that you have access to. Then, follow the next step.
    2. Download the repo from: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss

2. Please download the sift1M dataset from ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz if it does not exist, and unzip it to the subdirectory sift1M, and move it to `data` directory. Make sure while downloading that quiet flag is used (e.g., --no-verbose for wget), otherwise we will exceed context length. 

Question: 

Which of these 2 index types, hnsw and ivf, requires the least amount of memory to run and can reach a recall rate of at least 96%, using their default settings? For hnsw, use /starter_file/faiss/benchs/bench_hnsw.py, where the default settings are a fixed k value of 10, M value of 32, and efConstruction value of 40. For ivf, use /starter_file/faiss/benchs/bench_ivf_fastscan.py.
