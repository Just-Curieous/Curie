What is the best AWS EC2 instance type within the c5 family (instances listed below) for running an e-commerce web application serving 500 concurrent requests to its add_to_cart function, aiming to minimise cost while maintaining a 99th percentile latency below 150ms? Do not terminate until you identify the best instance type concretely.

C5 family instance types: c5.large, c5.xlarge, c5.2xlarge, c5.4xlarge, c5.9xlarge

Make sure to review Cloud/workload setup and code in the following first by "ls -la" and "cat": /starter_file/cloud_infra/best_instance

The best instance type will: 
- Maintain the 99th percentile latency under 150ms for the network I/O operations.
- Minimize the total cost per hour of operation. You can assume that instance cost increases as with the size of the instance (e.g., c5.large is cheaper than c5.xlarge).
