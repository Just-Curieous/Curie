# Design:

{
    "constant_vars": [
        "workload_type=compute-bound",
    ],
    "independent_vars": [
        "ec2_instance_type=[t3.medium, c5.large, r5.large, m6i.large, t3a.large]"
    ],
    "dependent_vars": [
        "CPU throughput (events per second)"
    ],
}

# Setup: refer to misc/optional_setup_q5_q6_q7.txt. Also, check if "events per second" is used as the metric.
