c5.large, and an answer is also considered acceptable if the LLM chose to ignore cheaper instances that had a tested latency under 150ms, but was at the borderline of 150ms (i.e., the argument could be that for a better guarantee that the latency requirement is accepted, we should not use those cheaper instances). 

Example output: (note: the exact format or structure does not matter)
- **c5.large**: 
  - Latencies: 142 ms and 141 ms
  - Cost: $0.0363/hour
  - Meets latency requirement.
