How does CPU efficiency scale differ with these different AWS EC2 instance types, i.e., t3.medium vs. c5.large, under a fixed compute-bound workload? Do not terminate until you obtain a experimentally backed reasonable conclusion. 

Make sure to review Cloud/workload setup and code in the following first by "ls -la" and "cat": /starter_file/cloud_infra/cpu_workload/sysbench_workload
