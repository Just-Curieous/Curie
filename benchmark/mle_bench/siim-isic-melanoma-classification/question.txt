Develop a machine learning model to predict the probability that a skin lesion image is malignant (melanoma), with the goal of maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) on the test set.

**Data:**
- **Images:** Available in DICOM, JPEG, and TFRecord formats (TFRecords resized to 1024x1024).
- **Metadata:**
  - `image_name`: Unique identifier linking to the image file.
  - `patient_id`: Unique patient identifier.
  - `sex`: Patient's sex (may be blank if unknown).
  - `age_approx`: Approximate age of the patient.
  - `anatom_site_general_challenge`: Body location of the lesion.
  - **Training-only columns:**
    - `diagnosis`: Detailed diagnosis information.
    - `target`: Binary label (0 = benign, 1 = malignant).

**Key Considerations:**
- **Patient-Level Contextual Information:** Enhance predictions by leveraging multiple images from the same patient (e.g., identifying outliers among a patientâ€™s lesions).
- **Validation:** Split training data by `patient_id` to ensure all images from a patient are in either training or validation (not both), simulating generalization to new patients in the test set.

**Goal:** Achieve the highest AUC-ROC score by predicting a probability (0.0 to 1.0) of malignancy for each test set image, using any combination of image data and metadata.
