You are tasked with building a **multi-label text classification model** that detects six types of comment toxicity: `toxic`, `severe_toxic`, `obscene`, `threat`, `insult`, and `identity_hate`. Find the best-performing model and configuration (preprocessing, architecture, training strategy) to maximize mean ROC AUC.


**Goal**: Maximize the **mean column-wise ROC AUC** across these six labels on a test set of Wikipedia comments.

**Output**:
A CSV file with format:

```
id,toxic,severe_toxic,obscene,threat,insult,identity_hate
```

Each field contains a predicted probability.

**Constraints**:

* Each label is binary (multi-label setup).
* Comments may include offensive or profane language.
* Ensure generalization to unseen comments.
