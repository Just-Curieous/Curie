You are tasked with building the best-performing image classification model for the **Dog Breed Identification** task.  

**Problem:** Given a set of dog images (training set with labels and a test set without labels), predict the breed of each dog. There are **120 possible breeds**.  

**Goal:** Create a model that, for each test image, outputs a probability distribution across all 120 breeds.  

**Evaluation:** Your model will be judged by **multi-class log loss** between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.  

**Input Data:**
- `train/`: training images with provided breed labels (from `labels.csv`)
- `test/`: test images for prediction
- `sample_submission.csv`: format for your output (one row per test image, one column per breed)  

**Requirements:**
- Optimize the model for lowest multi-class log loss.
- Output a prediction file matching the `sample_submission.csv` format.

**Reference Dataset:** Based on the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**, a subset of ImageNet.  

**Deliverable:**  
Produce the best model/configuration and generate a `submission.csv` file as per the required format.
