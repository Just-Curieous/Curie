"The effectiveness of a certain method (e.g.,Read question, Selfverification, Making equations, Repeat state, Think about words))largely depends on the nature of the question. For math questions dataset, such as gsm8k, making equations improves the accuracy.

Ground truth: Equations, think about words, and self-verification are better, than using repeating the question

Repeating the question:93.1
Self-verification:93.4
Making equations:93.5
Think about words:93.6
