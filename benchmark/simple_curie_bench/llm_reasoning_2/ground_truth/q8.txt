"Ground truth:   More complex tasks with higher logical and mathematical operations required more reasoning steps, whereas simpler pattern recognition tasks required fewer steps before performance declined.

Example:

#### Control Group Results (`gsm8k` with `gsm8k_1`):
- **Result 1 Accuracy:** 92.5
- **Result 2 Accuracy:** 90.0

#### Experimental Group Results:

### Analysis and Conclusion

1. **Task Complexity and Reasoning Steps:**
   - For `gsm8k`, the accuracy was higher with demo files that added more reasoning steps (`gsm8k_3`).
   - For `last_letters`, demo files with moderate reasoning steps (`last_letters_2`, `last_letters_3`, `last_letters_4`) had the highest accuracy.
   - `last_letters_6` with longer reasoning steps showed a drop in accuracy, indicating a threshold beyond which additional reasoning steps are detrimental.
   - `last_letters_10` resulted in 0% accuracy, suggesting excessive reasoning steps led to failure in task performance.

2. **Optimal Reasoning Steps:**
   - `gsm8k`: Optimal steps are seen in `gsm8k_3`.
   - `last_letters`: Optimal steps are seen in `last_letters_2`, `last_letters_3`, `last_letters_4`.

3. **Impact of Task Complexity:**
   - More complex tasks with higher logical and mathematical operations required more reasoning steps, whereas simpler pattern recognition tasks required fewer steps before performance declined."
