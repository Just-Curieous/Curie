"The implementation of different prompting methods like Zero-shot, Auto-CoT and their impact on accuracy can be systematically improved by varying the number of reasoning steps, without adding new content, in a tightly controlled experiment setting, by using methods such as adding sentences that restate the question to increase steps. For zero-shot, add a prompt ""you must think more steps"" after “Let’s think step by step” to increase the reasoning steps.
For Auto-Cot, few-shots, add reasoning steps in demo(as an example provided in prompt). Adding more steps in reasoning will increase the accuracy, both for auto_cot and zero_cot
