Expected outcome:

larger d = higher recall, latency and memory
larger nt = higher recall. same latency and memory
larger nb = higher latency, recall not sure cannot compare, memory same
larger nq = higher latency, memory and recall no change

Q: what you found was not observed?

What we found instead:

larger d = consistently high/higher recall, higher memory, higher latency
larger nt = consistently high/higher recall, same memory, higher latency
larger nb = consistently high recall, higher memory, higher latency
larger nq = consistently high/higher recall, same memory, higher latency
