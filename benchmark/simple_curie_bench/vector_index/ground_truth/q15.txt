Setup: check that 5 runs were actually done, with required parameters passed to the script correctly. 

- The HNSW index on the SIFT1M dataset consistently achieves high recall and low latency, with an error range for recall of approximately Â±0.0005 and latency per query consistently around 0.111 ms.

The experiment has successfully addressed the question by confirming that the HNSW algorithm exhibits consistent recall and latency when run on the SIFT1M dataset five times with the specified parameters. The determined error range for recall is approximately 0.9948 to 0.9957, and for latency, it is 0.111 to 0.114 seconds.
