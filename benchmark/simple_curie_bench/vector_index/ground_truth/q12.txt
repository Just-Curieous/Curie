Based on the results, we can conclude the following trends for achieving at least 90% recall:

#### As d values increase:
- M values need to: Slightly increase to maintain high recall as dimensions increase.
- efConstruction values need to: Increase to handle more complex graph structures.
- efSearch values need to: Increase to maintain recall performance with higher dimensions.

#### As nb values increase:
- M values need to: Increase to support more connections in the graph.
- efConstruction values need to: Increase to ensure the graph is well-connected.
- efSearch values need to: Increase to maintain high recall even with larger datasets.

#### As nq values increase:
- M values need to: Remain stable, as they primarily affect graph connectivity.
- efConstruction values need to: Remain stable, since they influence graph construction rather than query performance.
- efSearch values need to: Increase to ensure higher recall with more queries.
