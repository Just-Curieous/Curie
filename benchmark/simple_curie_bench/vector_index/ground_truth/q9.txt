efConstruction or M increase:
- recall, memory, latency increase

efSearch increase:
- recall, latency increase. Memory negligible change

`efSearch` is most sensitive to recall improvements and latency increases during querying. `M` heavily influences memory usage and latency during both construction and querying. `efConstruction` impacts the recall and latency during construction.
