Setup: check that np.random is used to construct the dataset, and that it is somehow passed and used as the dataset in the HNSW index. 
Variables: check that mean, variance and dataset size are all varied individually and tested to see their effects. 
Expected result:
1. **Effect on Increasing Data Size**: The HNSW index generally maintains high recall as data size increases, with occasional slight performance drops in certain cases.
2. **Effect on Increasing Mean**: The recall is not significantly affected by changes in the mean, showing robustness.
3. **Effect on Increasing Variance**: The recall remains mostly stable, with some rare instances of decreased performance.
