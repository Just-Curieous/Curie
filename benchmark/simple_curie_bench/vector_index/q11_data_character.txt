Instructions: 
1. Set up the environment using `pip install faiss-cpu`.

2. Please use `np.random.random` to construct normal distribution synthetic dataset Refer to `faiss/tutorial/python/1-Flat.py` for code.

3. Read faiss/benchs/bench_hnsw.py. You will use this script for testing the HNSW index with the synthetic dataset. You will need to adapt the script to be able to use this synthetic dataset.

Question: 

How does the synthetic data characteristics (data size, mean, variance) affect the index HNSW performance in terms of recall?

Output your answer exactly like this:

Effect on incresing data size: <text>
Effect on incresing mean: <text>
Effect on increasing variance: <text>
