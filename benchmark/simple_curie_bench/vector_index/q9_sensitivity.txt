The starter file can be found under "faiss"

Instructions: 
1. Set up the environment. `pip install faiss-cpu`

2. Please download the sift1M dataset from ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz if it does not exist, and unzip it to the subdirectory sift1M, and move it to `data` directory. Make sure while downloading that quiet flag is used (e.g., --no-verbose for wget), otherwise we will exceed context length. 

3. Read faiss/benchs/bench_hnsw.py. You will use this script for testing the HNSW index with SIFT1M dataset. Make sure to provide all input arguments required by the file. There are 3 of them. 

Question: 

Determine which parameters of the HNSW index is the most sensitive parameters to its recall, memory and latency on sift1M dataset. Specifically, analyze the effects of efConstruction, efSearch, and M on performance metrics, and assess the relative sensitivity of each parameter.

Output your answer exactly like this:

Effect of increasing efConstruction on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>

Effect of increasing efSearch on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>

Effect of increasing M on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>
