The starter file can be found under "/starter_file/faiss"

Instructions: 
1. Set up the environment. 

2. Please download the sift1M dataset from ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/sift.tar.gz if it does not exist, and unzip it to the subdirectory sift1M, and move it to `data` directory. Make sure while downloading that quiet flag is used (e.g., --no-verbose for wget), otherwise we will exceed context length. 

3. Read /starter_file/faiss/benchs/bench_hnsw.py. You will use this script for testing the HNSW index with SIFT1M dataset. Make sure to provide all input arguments required by the file. There are 3 of them. 

Question: 
What is the optimal combination of M and efSearch to minimize memory usage while maintaining a recall of at least 90%? Use k=10, efConstruction=40, and use varying M values of 16, 24, 32. efSearch is not a parameter that you need to touch.
