Summary Table
Parameter	Relevance	Impact	Guideline
nt	Training data for codebooks	Poor training degrades accuracy; sufficient nt improves recall by reducing quantization error.	Use 10xâ€“100x the number of codewords per subspace.
nb	Number of database vectors	Larger datasets benefit more from PQ compression but require high-quality training and tuning.	Ensure nt is proportional to nb. Consider clustering (IVF) for very large datasets.
nq	Number of query vectors	Affects throughput and accuracy benchmarking. Too few queries may not reflect real performance.	Use at least 1000 queries for benchmarking; test realistic workloads for high nq
