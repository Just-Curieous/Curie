The starter file can be found under "/starter_file/faiss"

Instructions: 
1. Set up the environment. 

2. You can construct the synthetic dataset using `from faiss.contrib.datasets import SyntheticDataset`, example: `ds = SyntheticDataset(d, nt, nb, nq)`.

3. Read /starter_file/faiss/benchs/bench_hnsw.py. You will use this script for testing the HNSW index. Make sure to provide all input arguments required by the file. There are 3 of them. 

Question: 

What is the relationship or trend in the HNSW parameters (M, efConstruction, efSearch) required to achieve at least 90% recall as we increase dataset dimensions (d), size (nb), or query count (nq) in SyntheticDatasets?

Test the following d values: 32, 64
Test the following nb values: 200000, 100000
Test the following nq values: 500, 1000

Output your answer exactly like this:

To achieve at least 90% recall as d values increase:
- M values need to: <text>
- efConstruction values need to: <text>
- efSearch values need to: <text>

To achieve at least 90% recall as nb values increase:
- M values need to: <text>
- efConstruction values need to: <text>
- efSearch values need to: <text>

To achieve at least 90% recall as nq values increase:
- M values need to: <text>
- efConstruction values need to: <text>
- efSearch values need to: <text>
