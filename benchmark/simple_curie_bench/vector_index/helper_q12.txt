- Graph Construction:

M (number of neighbors): Higher values improve accuracy but increase memory usage and construction time.
efConstruction (connectivity): Larger values improve the graph's quality and accuracy but increase build time.

- Search Efficiency:

efSearch (candidate list size): 
Higher values improve recall at the cost of increased search time.

- Dataset Size and Complexity:

Small datasets (nb in tens of thousands): 
Lower M and efConstruction can suffice for acceptable performance.
Large datasets (nb in millions): Higher M and efConstruction are required for accuracy, but memory and compute resources become critical.

- Training Data (nt):

Ensure training data represents the full data distribution to avoid poor clustering or quantization.

- Query Load (nq):

Balance nq and efSearch to achieve desired throughput while maintaining acceptable recall.
