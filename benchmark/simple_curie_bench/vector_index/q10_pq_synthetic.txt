The starter file can be found under "/starter_file/faiss"

Instructions: 
1. Set up the environment. 

2. You can construct the synthetic dataset using `from faiss.contrib.datasets import SyntheticDataset`, example: `ds = SyntheticDataset(d, nt, nb, nq)`.

3. Read /starter_file/faiss/benchs/bench_hnsw.py. You will need to adapt this script for testing the HNSW index with various synthetic datasets.

Question: 

For different constructed SyntheticDataset, how does d, nt, nb, nq affects the index performance (recall, memory and latency) for PQ?

Output your answer exactly like this:

Effect of increasing d on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>

Effect of increasing nt on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>

Effect of increasing nb on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>

Effect of increasing nq on:
- recall: <text>
- memory: <text>
- latency: <text>
