Task description:
Spaceship-titanic is a classification task predicting passenger survival in a tabular dataset inspired by Titanic data. Modify the code in the `env/train.py` script (there is placeholder specified code block for you to modify) to perform this task.

Instructions:
- Checkout the code dependency and set up the environment:
```
cd /starter_file/MLAgentBench
pip install -e .
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y -q
pip install -q -r requirements.txt
```

- Install Kaggle
```
export KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR=/starter_file/MLAgentBench/.kaggle
pip install kaggle
sudo apt-get install unzip -y
```

- Refer to the benchmark question under `MLAgentBench/benchmarks/spaceship-titanic/`.
```
cd MLAgentBench/benchmarks/spaceship-titanic
```

Here is your task:
- Go through the `env/task_descriptor.txt` file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
- Then fill in the provided `env/train.py` script to train a model on CPU and iterate over different models or parameters to get a better classification accuracy. Report the accuracy for each trial. You must execute it by going into the env/ directory:
```
cd env
python train.py
cd .. 
```
- You should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.

- Finally, evaluate the model performance via:
```
cd scripts
python eval.py
cd ..
```

Goal: 
Identify the model and its configuration that achieve the best performance, and report the results. Make sure to report the accuracy for each configuration as well.
