#### Control Group Results
- **Execution Times**:
  - Result 1: 1.62 seconds
  - Result 2: 1.64 seconds

These results represent the baseline execution speed of the `env/train.py` script without any vectorization enhancements.

#### Experimental Group Results
- **Execution Times**:
  - Result 1: 
    - 0.042 seconds
    - 0.0035 seconds
    - 0.0035 seconds
  - Result 2: 
    - 0.011 seconds
    - 0.012 seconds
    - 0.051 seconds

The experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in execution time compared to the control group, confirming the effectiveness of the vectorization techniques applied. The results are consistent across multiple test runs.
