Ground truth: a reasonable accuracy similar or higher to the following. 
#### Control Group
- **Model**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF
- **Accuracy**: 88.292%
- **Reproducibility**: Results were consistent across two runs.

#### Experimental Group (Partition 1)
- **Model**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF and Synonym Augmentation
- **Accuracy**: 85.768%
- **Reproducibility**: Results were consistent across two runs.

### Conclusion
The control group, using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF, achieved higher accuracy compared to the experimental group with synonym augmentation. This suggests that in this context, adding synonym augmentation did not enhance model performance, potentially due to noise introduced by synonyms in sentiment contexts.
