Ground truth:
A reasonable model should achieve an overall SMAPE score lower than the baseline while maintaining stable performance across all four UPDRS subscores.

Baseline (from current train.py run):

updrs_0 SMAPE scores: 63.5, 53.9, 44.8, 52.9, 43.9, 53.1, 49.5, 56.8
→ Mean SMAPE: 52.3
updrs_1 SMAPE scores: 59.8, 58.6, 49.0, 50.3, 64.1, 66.3, 55.0, 73.2
→ Mean SMAPE: 59.5
updrs_2 SMAPE scores: 49.1, 67.4, 49.9, 45.8, 56.7, 61.1, 44.2, 46.6
→ Mean SMAPE: 52.6
updrs_3 SMAPE scores: 76.2, 83.8, 87.3, 78.8, 84.0, 83.0, 77.7, 80.6
→ Mean SMAPE: 81.4
Overall SMAPE (average of the four means above): 61.46
Conclusion:
This baseline defines the expected level of performance for the task. Any model achieving an overall SMAPE lower than 61.46 is considered an improvement. Future experiments should aim to reduce this value while keeping individual subscore performance stable. All modifications and results should be clearly documented and compared against this baseline.
