The success rate generally improves with an increase in the number of generated samples. However, the improvement is not perfectly linear. Instead, it shows diminishing returns as the number of samples increases beyond a certain point. This suggests a sub-linear or logarithmic pattern, where initial increases in sample size provide significant improvements, but the rate of improvement decreases as more samples are added.
