No definitive answer. Depends on when test was taken. Check setup, and if "events per second" is used as the metric. 

#### Control Group (t3.medium):
- **Result 1**: 
  - Events per second: 43.38
  - Total time: 10.0022s
  - Average Latency: 23.04 ms
- **Result 2**:
  - Events per second: 46.07
  - Total time: 10.0051s
  - Average Latency: 21.70 ms

#### Experimental Group:
1. **c5.large**:
   - **Result 1**: Time Taken: 10.0053s, CPU Utilization: 50.03%
   - **Result 2**: Time Taken: 10.0006s, CPU Utilization: 48.75%
2. **r5.large**:
   - **Result 1**: Time Taken: 10.0146s, CPU Utilization: 51.71%
   - **Result 2**: Time Taken: 10.0006s, CPU Utilization: 49.04%
3. **m6i.large**:
   - **Result 1**: Time Taken: 10.0002s, CPU Utilization: 43.27%
   - **Result 2**: Time Taken: 10.0038s, CPU Utilization: 42.81%
4. **t3a.large**:
   - **Result 1**: Time Taken: 10.0116s, CPU Utilization: 54.03%
   - **Result 2**: Time Taken: 10.0103s, CPU Utilization: 59.18%

### Summary and Conclusion:
The results consistently show that the `m6i.large` instance type had the lowest CPU utilization, suggesting it is the most CPU efficient among the tested types for the specific compute-bound workload. Conversely, the `t3a.large` showed the highest CPU utilization, indicating it is the least efficient under these conditions. 

#### Ranking of Instances Based on CPU Efficiency:
1. **m6i.large** (Most Efficient)
2. **c5.large**
3. **r5.large**
4. **t3.medium** (Baseline for comparison)
5. **t3a.large** (Least Efficient)
