"c5.large should be best to balance both, and an answer is also considered acceptable if the LLM chose to ignore cheaper instances that had a tested latency under 150ms, but was at the borderline of 150ms (i.e., the argument could be that for a better guarantee that the latency requirement is accepted, we should not use those cheaper instances). 

For latency: should have a decreasing trend as we increase instance size, but not a requirement. In general, all should meet the requirements

For cost: it should increase as the instance size increases. "
