"#### **Results Summary**

1. **t3.medium (Control Group)**
   - **Average CPU Speed:** 1.36-1.41 events per second
   - **Average Memory Throughput:** 12,582.81-12,850.44 MiB/sec

2. **t3.large**
   - **Average CPU Speed:** 1.60 events per second
   - **Average Memory Throughput:** 13,505.05 MiB/sec

3. **c5.large**
   - **Average CPU Speed:** 2.03 events per second
   - **Average Memory Throughput:** 18,086.20-18,085.59 MiB/sec

4. **c5.xlarge**
   - **Average CPU Speed:** 2.03 events per second
   - **Average Memory Throughput:** 18,128.16-18,115.74 MiB/sec

#### **Ranking Based on CPU Efficiency**
- **1st:** c5.large and c5.xlarge (tie)
- **3rd:** t3.large
- **4th:** t3.medium

#### **Inter-Family Comparison**
- The **c5 family** consistently outperforms the **t3 family** in both CPU speed and memory throughput. The higher performance is attributed to the newer CPU architectures in c5 instances and absence of CPU credit throttling seen in burstable t3 instances.
- Within the c5 family, both instances (c5.large and c5.xlarge) show similar performance, suggesting that the increased resources in c5.xlarge do not significantly affect the mixed workload used in this experiment."
