"**Control Group (t3a.large):**
- **Run 1:** CPU speed: 66.89 events per second
- **Run 2:** CPU speed: 65.58 events per second

The results for the control group are consistent and reflect expected performance for the `t3a.large` instance type.

**Experimental Group:**

- **m5.large:**
  - **CPU speed:** Approximately 52.61 events per second
  
- **m6a.large:**
  - **CPU speed:** Approximately 242.96 events per second

### Summary and Conclusion
The experimental data shows that the `m6a.large` instance type with the latest 3rd generation AMD EPYC processors performs significantly better in the compute-bound workload than both the `t3a.large` and `m5.large` instance types. The performance gain aligns with the improved CPU architecture in the `m6a.large` instances, confirming the hypothesis that newer CPU architecture is a primary determinant of performance differences in this scenario.

### Final Conclusion:
The newer CPU architecture, especially in the `m6a.large` instance, is indeed the primary determinant of improved performance for a fixed compute-bound workload using sysbench with `-cpu-max-prime=80000`."
