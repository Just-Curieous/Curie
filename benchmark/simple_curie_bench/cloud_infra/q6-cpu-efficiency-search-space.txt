How does CPU efficiency differ with these different AWS EC2 instance types, i.e., t3.medium, c5.large, r5.large, m6i.large, t3a.large, under a fixed compute-bound workload? Rank the instances. Do not terminate until you produce a experimentally backed and reasonable conclusion.

Make sure to review Cloud/workload setup and code in the following first by "ls -la" and "cat": /starter_file/cloud_infra/cpu_workload/sysbench_workload
