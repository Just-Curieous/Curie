  "design": ":\n- **Independent Variables**: Trajectory generation method; Model-generated and Reference.\n- **Dependent Variables**: JSD values for backbone and sidechain torsion angles, and top TICA components.\n- **Control Variables**: Tetrapeptides simulated, concatenated trajectories for each method.",
  "conclusion": ":\nThe experiment concluded that the model-generated trajectories did not closely adhere to the distributional properties of reference MD simulations, as implied by the higher JSD metrics. Future work should focus on refining trajectory generation techniques, enhancing model training protocols, and resolving script configuration issues ensuring efficient workflow execution and data analysis."
