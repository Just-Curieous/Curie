  "design": "- **Independent Variables:** \n  - Ground truth MD trajectories sampled at **100 fs**\n  - Subsampled trajectories at **10 ps**\n  - MDGEN-generated **upsampled trajectories** (from 10 ps → 100 fs)\n\n- **Dependent Variables:** \n  - **Autocorrelation Function**: ⟨cos(θₜ − θₜ₊Δₜ)⟩ for torsion angles over lag times from **100 fs to 100 ps**.\n  - **Dynamic Content**: The negative derivative of the autocorrelation with respect to log-timescale.\n\n### Experimental Setup and Implementation\n- **Data Preparation:** \n  - Used test peptide trajectories, with a focus on 30,000 frames pooled together. Ground truth MD data was sampled at regular 100 fs intervals.\n  - Generated subsampled versions at 10 ps by downsampling the ground truth.\n\n- **Model Upsampling:**\n  - Trajectory data from the subsampled set was input into a pre-trained MDGEN model to produce reconstructed trajectories at a resolution of 100 fs.\n\n- **Computation and Analysis:**\n  - Analysis focused on evaluating torsion angle behavior using autocorrelation calculations and conducting dynamic content analysis.\n  - Planned comparison across different trajectories: ground truth, subsampled, and MDGEN-generated.\n\n### Challenges Encountered\nThe experiment faced numerous technical challenges, notably due to missing data files and improperly managed directories. These issues impeded script creation and execution, limiting the ability to produce quantifiable results.",
  "conclusion": "The investigation into MDGEN’s capability to reconstruct subsampled dynamics remains inconclusive due to technical barriers. Key conclusions drawn:\n\n- Persistent execution errors due to mismanagement of data files thwarted experimental success.\n- Future work should prioritize resolving logistical issues in data handling and script execution to facilitate proper experimentation.\n\nRecommendations for future experiments include ensuring comprehensive file setup, and iterating on the experimental design to successfully perform analyzes on reconstructed trajectories.\n\n## Appendices\n### Supplementary Materials\nNone available due to the lack of complete experimental data generation.\n\n### Example Scripts\nA shell script `reproduce_exp_bench.sh` will be provided to set up the environment, execute the experiment, and reproduce results once file access issues have been resolved.\n\n### Log and Error Analysis\n- Log excerpts indicate repeated attempts to execute script tasks with continuous errors due to missing file paths and directories.\n- Future suggestion includes dedicated time to resolve structural data issues to enable analysis of reconstructed trajectories.\n\nThis report intends to convey the functional intent, barriers, and recommendations for the future regarding the MDGEN model's use in molecular dynamics trajectory recovery."
