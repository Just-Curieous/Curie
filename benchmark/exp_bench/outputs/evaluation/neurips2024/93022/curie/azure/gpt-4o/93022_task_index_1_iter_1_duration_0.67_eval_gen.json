  "design": "The primary objective is the comparison of model-generated and ground-truth trajectories using simulation condition equivalent metrics. The design entails:\n\n- **Independent Variables**: \n  - **Trajectory Generation Method**: MDGEN model versus reference MD simulations.\n  \n- **Dependent Variables**: \n  - **Distributional Similarity**: Evaluated via Jensen-Shannon Divergence across specified angles and components.",
  "conclusion": "The experiment indicates a promising level of distributional similarity between model-generated and ground-truth MD trajectories for backbone and sidechain torsions. However, TICA component evaluation reveals divergence requiring further inquiry. Future work should emphasize flexible script functionality, ensuring requisite command and data handling capacities, alongside robust directory configurations to facilitate reproducibility. Enhanced model training and validation studies are recommended to assess statistical significance and potential improvements to MDGEN simulation fidelity."
