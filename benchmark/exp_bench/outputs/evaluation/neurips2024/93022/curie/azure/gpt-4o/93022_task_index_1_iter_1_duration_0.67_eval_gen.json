  "design": "**Independent Variables:**\n- **Trajectory Generation Method:** \n  - Model-generated: Using the MDGEN model conditioned on the first frame.\n  - Reference: Ground-truth trajectories from 100 ns MD simulations.\n\n**Dependent Variables:**\n- **Distributional Similarity**: Measured using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) over different angles and TICA components.\n- **Sampling Speed**: Although optional, provides qualitative context.",
  "conclusion": "### Conclusion\n\nThe expected outcome comparing MDGEN-generated trajectories with reference trajectories remained inconclusive due to technical hurdles in execution scripts. While partial results indicate certain trajectory metrics, comprehensive data analysis was unattainable.\n\n### Future Work\n\nFuture iterations should address the script creation and execution errors, possibly by:\n- Implementing stricter checks and debug steps for path validation.\n- Automating error logging with detailed debug information.\n- Running simulations and analytic scripts sequentially ensuring script dependencies.\n\nThis iterative refinement will be critical in accurately benchmarking model performance against genuine MD data."
