  "design": "#### Independent Variables\n- Model Architecture:\n  - SiT with original time attention mechanism.\n  - SiT with non-causal Hyena operator.\n- Lag Time Range for autocorrelation analysis: 100 fs to 100 ps.\n\n#### Dependent Variables\n- Trajectory Quality: Agreement of torsional autocorrelation functions with ground-truth data.\n- Dynamical Relaxations: Dynamical content, computed as the negative derivative of autocorrelation vs. log-timescale.\n\n### Experimental Setup\n1. **Data**: \n   - Pentapeptide MDGEN dataset: 100k-frame, 10 ns trajectories.\n   - Preprocessing to preserve fast and slow timescale dynamics.\n2. **Model Training**: \n   - Train within a PyTorch Lightning framework, using specified hyperparameters.\n3. **Trajectory Generation**: \n   - Generate one long trajectory (10 ns) from both SiT configurations.\n4. **Evaluation**:\n   - Compute torsional autocorrelation functions over specified lag times.\n   - Derive dynamic content curves.\n   - Compare the results against a ground-truth trajectory generated via MD.\n\n### Execution Progress\n\nThe workflow comprised three main scripts as per agent instructions: training, inference, and analysis scripts. Despite following the predetermined command sequence, challenges emerged, particularly with missing files and directory issues that hindered full execution.",
  "conclusion": "Due to the incomplete execution of scripts and data retrievability issues, a definitive conclusion could not be derived regarding the enhanced trajectory generation with the non-causal Hyena operator. Future experiments should focus on:\n- Ensuring comprehensive file management and script accessibility.\n- Debugging procedural workflow, especially the script execution and logging mechanisms.\n- Building robustness in script execution to handle directory-related discrepancies effectively.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Supplementary Materials \n\n- Experiment Logs: Unavailable due to incomplete script execution.\n- Script Directory Details: As referenced in agent instructions (`train.py`, `sim_inference.py`, `scripts/analyze_peptide_sim`).\n\n### Output Directory\nFor the JSON output, saved to: `outputs/tmp_prompt_gen/93022_task_index_1_iter_1_duration_0.67_eval_gen.json`\n\n### Shell Script\n\nA shell script `reproduce_exp_bench.sh` to reproduce the experiment end-to-end, focusing on environment setup, script running, and output production, is required to enhance future reproducibility. It would primarily include commands for dependency installation, followed by script executions.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash"
