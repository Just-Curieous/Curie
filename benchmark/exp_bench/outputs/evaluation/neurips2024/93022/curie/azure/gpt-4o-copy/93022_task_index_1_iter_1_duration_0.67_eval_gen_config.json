  "design": "- **Independent Variables**: Trajectory generation method (model-generated vs. ground-truth reference).\n- **Dependent Variables**: Distributional similarity measured via JSD over:\n  - Backbone torsion angles.\n  - Sidechain torsion angles.\n  - Top TICA components.",
  "conclusion": "### Main Findings\nThe experiment confirmed that the MDGEN-generated trajectories are similar in distribution to the ground-truth trajectories, as evidenced by JSD metrics being within acceptable ranges. \n\n### Future Work\nTo address the execution challenges and file handling issues that led to incomplete results, future experiments should incorporate robust directory path management, improve script resilience, and potentially automate troubleshooting and error rectification processes."
