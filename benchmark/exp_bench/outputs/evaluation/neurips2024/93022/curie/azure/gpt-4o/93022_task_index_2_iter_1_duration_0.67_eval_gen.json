  "design": "The experiment comprises generating 100 ns-equivalent trajectories for test tetrapeptides using two methods: MDGEN and conventional MD simulations.\n\n### Independent Variables\n1. **Simulation Method**:\n   - MDGEN simulations on NVIDIA A6000 GPU.\n   - Conventional MD simulations on NVIDIA T4 or A100 GPU.\n\n2. **Hardware Used**:\n   - MDGEN: NVIDIA A6000 GPU\n   - MD: NVIDIA T4 or A100 GPU\n\n### Dependent Variables\n1. **Wall-clock Time**:\n   - Measurement in GPU-seconds for MDGEN and GPU-hours for conventional MD.\n\n2. **Accuracy Metrics**:\n   - Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) of torsion distributions.\n   - Torsion angle relaxation times.\n   - Free energy surface (FES) comparisons via Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA).",
  "conclusion": "The experiment has demonstrated conventional MD simulation benchmarks (e.g., runtime and accuracy metrics) but faced impediments that precluded MDGEN data collection. Future work should resolve directory-related setup issues to complete MDGEN simulations, ensuring a robust comparison to determine speed and accuracy viability over conventional methods."
