  "design": "This experiment involved comparing transition paths generated by MDGEN and MSMs from shorter MD trajectories against MSM constructed using a 100 ns trajectory as ground truth. \n\n1. **Independent Variables**:\n   - Transition Path Generation Method:\n     - MDGEN (1 ns rollouts conditioned on start/end frames).\n     - MSMs from MD trajectories of varying durations (50 ns, 30 ns, 20 ns, 10 ns).\n\n2. **Dependent Variables**:\n   - Path Likelihood under the reference MSM.\n   - Fraction of Valid Paths.\n   - Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the state distributions.\n\n### Experimental Setup\n\n- **Reference MSM**: A MSM was constructed from a 100 ns trajectory, identifying 10 metastable states. Start and end states were chosen based on minimal flux separation.\n- **Trajectory Generation**: For each peptide, 1 ns interpolated trajectories were generated using MDGEN and sampled paths from MSMs of various durations.\n- **Path Discretization**: All paths were discretized into identified metastable states.\n- **Metric Computation**:\n  - Path Likelihood measures average transition probability.\n  - Valid Paths are those with non-zero probability.\n  - JSD assesses divergence in state distributions compared to the reference model.\n\n### Experimental Process\n\nA transition path sampling inference script was developed using a pre-trained MDGEN model checkpoint for processing peptide data. Analysis scripts evaluated path quality using PyEMMA for MSM building and MDTraj for trajectory manipulation. Systematic challenges were encountered, particularly missing critical files hindering complete workflow execution.",
  "conclusion": "This experimental study provides partial support to the hypothesis that MDGEN-generated transition paths are statistically more consistent with the reference MSM than paths from MD-derived MSMs of shorter durations. Future experiments should aim to complete all result pathways by addressing file access and execution hurdles. Enhanced workspace configurations could ensure seamless execution, and further iterations may explore expanded peptide samples with adjusted model parameters.\n\n## Appendices\n\nDetails of raw log directories:\n- Control Group: `/workspace/mdgen_task_index_3_iter_1_duration_0.67/results_1195150d-af6c-4dd0-9d8f-233d2a1d5d92_control_group_partition_1.txt`\n\n### Experiment Reproduction Script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash"
