  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The design output correctly lists the independent variables and dependent variables, and it includes the dataset information. However, while it mentions model training, it omits explicit details of the training setup (e.g., data splits and runtime settings) that were part of the constant variables in the ground truth.",
  "design_score": 83,
  "design_error_analysis": "Out of the six ground truth items, the design output covered both independent and dependent variables fully (4 items) and only partially addressed the constant variables (1 out of 2 items is covered).",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The conclusion output does not match the ground truth. Instead of affirming the model's ability to generate long trajectories that mimic MD dynamics, it states that a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn due to execution issues.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "The predicted conclusion fails to capture the key findings\u2014that the non-causal Hyena-augmented SiT model can generate trajectories with MD-consistent dynamics, spanning multiple dynamical regimes\u2014and instead highlights procedural failures.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The provided setup_output is empty, meaning no changes were introduced. The ground truth specifies a complex experiment setup spread over three scripts (train.py, sim_inference.py, and analyze_peptide_sim.py) with clearly defined steps ranging from argument parsing to model initialization, training, and simulation analysis. None of these requirements are addressed in the empty diff. Each step (e.g., initializing wandb logging, creating data loaders, handling model checkpoints, performing rollouts, and computing TICA projections) is absent in the output.",
  "setup_score": 0,
  "setup_error_analysis": "No changes were implemented in the setup_output. This means that none of the required steps in the ground truth (all 21 steps, plus the final analysis step) have been satisfied. The diff did not include modifications that parse command line arguments, set up wandb, load datasets, initialize data loaders, configure the PyTorch Lightning trainer, handle inference, or perform trajectory analysis. Consequently, the experiment setup is entirely incomplete."
