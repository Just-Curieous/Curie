  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The design output correctly identifies the independent variables (the three models and the two transition types) and the dependent variable (sequence recovery rate) and it also includes steps for trajectory preparation, masking setup, and evaluation. However, some details from the constant variables (e.g., the fixed 100-ps transition window, consistent MSM analysis, and explicit mention of exact sequence matching) are only partially captured.",
  "design_score": 80,
  "design_error_analysis": "While all variable categories are mentioned, the output lacks specific details for the constant variables as stated in the ground truth, resulting in a slight loss in accuracy.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The ground truth conclusion emphasizes that MDGEN achieves significantly higher sequence recovery rates (with specific numerical ranges) and validates the importance of dynamics scaffolding. The output conclusion, however, focuses on systemic failures and experimental misalignments rather than comparing the models or providing the numerical performance differences.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "The conclusion output does not semantically match the ground truth because it omits the key findings regarding MDGEN's superior performance and the specific rate values, instead attributing issues to execution failures.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The setup output provided is empty and does not contain any modifications or diff patch. As a result, none of the thirteen required steps (loading a pre-trained MDGEN model, loading the dataset split from CSV, analyzing MD simulations, calculating the flux matrix, finding trajectory segments, preparing batches for inference, running model inpainting, converting outputs to PDB files, loading generated designs, extracting amino acid sequences, calculating recovery metrics, identifying the most frequent sequence, and printing recovery metrics) are implemented or modified. There is no evidence in the output that any of the actions described in the ground truth or the provided reference scripts are present.",
  "setup_score": 0,
  "setup_error_analysis": "Since the setup output diff patch is empty, all of the ground truth requirements are missing. There are no changes made to any part of the code that would have satisfied any of the step-by-step actions required for the experiment setup. Therefore, the implementation fails to address any of the requirements."
