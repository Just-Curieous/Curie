  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The output correctly identified all independent and dependent variables and provided detailed data preparation steps. However, it omitted the explicit constant regarding the fixed model settings.",
  "design_score": 86,
  "design_error_analysis": "The design output did not mention the specific constant 'Model Settings' as described in the ground truth, which accounts for one missing item out of seven.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The conclusion did not semantically match the ground truth. The output focused on technical failures rather than stating the expected dynamic behavior.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "Instead of confirming that MDGEN-upsampled trajectories reproduce specific oscillatory dynamics and matching autocorrelation curves with non-monotonic dynamic content, the output cited technical issues and inconclusive results.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The ground truth requires two main Python scripts (one for inference named upsampling_inference.py and one for analysis named analyze_upsampling.py) with a detailed set of functionalities, including parsing specific command\u2010line arguments (with options like checkpoint path, data directory, batch size, split file, etc.), importing a suite of libraries for molecular dynamics and tensor operations, creating output directories, processing and converting trajectories (including splitting them into batches with conditioning intervals), running model inference and saving results in PDB/XT\u0421 formats, and finally computing and plotting autocorrelation functions with proper visualization parameters. In contrast, the provided diff shows changes to a shell script along with two Python scripts named trajectory_upsampling.py and trajectory_analysis.py. These scripts are largely skeleton implementations: the argument parsing is very minimal and does not match the expected parameters (for example, the upsampling script uses '--checkpoint_path' instead of the expected arguments and is missing batch size and split file parameters), and many of the core processing functions such as converting numpy files to trajectory representations, splitting batches, performing inference to generate PDB/XT\u0421 files, and detailed analysis (featurization, autocorrelation computations, and log-scale plot adjustments) are either absent or left as placeholders. Although the control shell script does create directories and invoke Python scripts, it does not compensate for the missing domain\u2013specific implementations required by the ground truth.",
  "setup_score": 12,
  "setup_error_analysis": "The output fails to meet most of the ground truth requirements. Specifically, it: (1) does not implement the upsampling_inference.py script as specified, missing detailed argument parsing, data processing (conversion of atom positions, batch splitting, etc.), and the inference logic; (2) does not implement the analysis script (analyze_upsampling.py) with the required functions for featurization, autocorrelation computation, and proper plotting on a logarithmic timescale; and (3) much of the core functionality is left as placeholders. The provided scripts only offer minimal command line parsing and basic file iteration, which is insufficient given the detailed setup expected."
