  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The design output captured most of the required variables: it correctly identifies the test peptides, trajectory length, independent variables (simulation method and hardware used), and the dependent variables (wall\u2010clock time and accuracy metrics). One constant variable, the trajectory generation protocol details, was missing.",
  "design_score": 86,
  "design_error_analysis": "Out of the 7 key items (3 constant, 2 independent, 2 dependent), the design output included 6 correctly. The missing component was the 'Trajectory Generation Protocol', which provided critical details on the simulation rollout differences between MDGEN and MD.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The predicted conclusion does not reflect the expected speedup or the accuracy criteria specified in the ground truth. Instead of noting that MDGEN is expected to be 10x\u20131000x faster while maintaining high fidelity, it discusses data collection issues and fails to mention quantifiable performance improvements and accuracy matches.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "The conclusion output omits the key conclusion points regarding speedup (10x\u20131000x faster) and the specific accuracy benchmarks (JSD, torsional decorrelation, FES, etc.) that were central to the ground truth. It instead focuses on procedural difficulties, which does not match the experimental outcomes described in the ground truth.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The ground truth requirements specify a 13\u2010step pipeline that includes loading a pretrained MDGEN simulation model, reading test peptide CSV data, preparing simulation batches (including expanding initial structures to the required number of frames), running multiple simulation rollouts (with timing), saving trajectories as PDB/XTC files, and then a detailed analysis phase (loading both MDGEN and reference trajectories, calculating Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence on torsion distributions, computing decorrelation times, performing TICA, comparing free energy surfaces, optionally building MSMs, and finally saving analysis results). The provided diff, however, is a control experiment shell script that sets up the environment and then sequentially calls several Python scripts (run_peptide_sim.py, train.py, tps_inference.py, upsampling_inference.py, design_inference.py) after checking for GPU availability. While the control script does pass a few parameters (for example, a CSV joblist for test peptides and a checkpoint parameter to design_inference.py) that superficially relate to some simulation steps, it does not explicitly implement many of the required simulation details (e.g., preparing batch data, properly running multiple simulation rollouts with time measurement, saving trajectories in both PDB and optionally XTC formats) nor does it invoke the analysis pipeline as required (steps 7\u201313, which include trajectory analysis with MDGEN and reference MD trajectories, computing JSD, decorrelation, TICA and MSM-related analyses, and saving outputs to a pickle file). In short, only a partial subset of the simulation procedure is remotely touched via the simulation scripts, and the entire analysis part is missing in the diff. Therefore, while the control script sets up and calls some experiment-related commands, it fails to cover the majority of the ground truth requirements.",
  "setup_score": 30,
  "setup_error_analysis": "Missing or incomplete implementation of several key steps: \n\u2022 The simulation script (sim_inference.py) is not directly invoked; instead, a different set of inference and training scripts are called (run_peptide_sim.py, design_inference.py, etc.) without clear evidence that they execute the precise steps (such as loading the pretrained model, batch preparation, running multiple rollouts, and saving PDB/XTC files) as described in steps 1\u20136. \n\u2022 The analysis phase (steps 7\u201313), which is critical for loading trajectories, computing JSD, decorrelation times, TICA, MSM, and saving the analysis results, is entirely absent from the control script. \nThese gaps indicate that the provided setup output does not meet a significant portion of the ground truth experiment requirements."
