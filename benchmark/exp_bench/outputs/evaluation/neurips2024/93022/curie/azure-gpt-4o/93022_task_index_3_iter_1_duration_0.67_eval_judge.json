  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The output correctly identifies the independent and dependent variables and most of the constant variables. It mentions the reference MSM (100 ns with 10 metastable states) and discretization into metastable states, as well as the two methods (MDGEN and various MSM durations) and the three evaluation metrics. However, it misses explicitly mentioning the evaluation on 100 test tetrapeptides, which is one of the constant variables.",
  "design_score": 88,
  "design_error_analysis": "The output omits the detail regarding the use of 100 test tetrapeptides in the experiment, resulting in one missing item out of the total required items.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The ground truth conclusion clearly states that MDGEN paths should show higher likelihood, a greater fraction of valid paths, and lower JSD values, consistently surpassing MSMs built on shorter MD durations. The output, however, only weakly supports the hypothesis by stating there is 'partial support' and does not explicitly mention the specific metric improvements.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "The predicted conclusion fails to assert the clear superiority of MDGEN paths in all specified metrics and describes the support as partial rather than consistent, which does not semantically match the ground truth.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The ground truth requirements specify a comprehensive workflow that includes loading a pre-trained MDGEN model from a checkpoint in tps_inference.py, loading peptide data from a CSV, processing molecular dynamics trajectories to build an MSM, identifying start and end states, generating transition path samples, saving these paths as PDB and XTC files along with metadata, and then performing further analysis in analyze_peptide_tps.py (including discretization, likelihood, and Jensen-Shannon Divergence calculations, as well as visualization of results). The provided diff, however, only shows modifications to a control experiment shell script and a small change in a train.py file to set a random seed. There are no changes addressing any of the steps outlined in the ground truth (steps 1\u201312 and final step), and the diff does not modify tps_inference.py or analyze_peptide_tps.py, which are critical to the ground truth workflow. In short, the setup_output does not implement any of the required MDGEN experiment workflow steps and instead only sets up environment configuration and a minor seeding adjustment.",
  "setup_score": 0,
  "setup_error_analysis": "The output fails to implement any of the required steps:\n1. There is no implementation for loading a pre-trained MDGEN model from the checkpoint in tps_inference.py (Step 1).\n2. The peptide data is not loaded from a CSV file referenced in the ground truth (Step 2).\n3. There is no code to load MD trajectory data or build a Markov State Model (MSM) as required (Step 3).\n4. The process for identifying the start and end states in the MSM is absent (Step 4).\n5. No transition path samples are generated using the MDGEN model in the diff (Step 5).\n6. There is no logic for saving generated paths as PDB and XTC files along with metadata (Step 6).\n7. The subsequent analysis steps in analyze_peptide_tps.py, including loading generated data and performing various statistical and visualization tasks (Steps 7\u201312 and Final Step), are not addressed.\nInstead, the provided diff only changes the execution shell script and sets the random seeds in the training script, which is unrelated to the detailed requirements outlined in the ground truth."
