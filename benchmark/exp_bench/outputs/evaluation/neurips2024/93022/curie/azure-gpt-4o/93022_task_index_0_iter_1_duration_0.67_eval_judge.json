  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The independent and dependent variables were correctly mentioned, including the use of JSD for backbone, sidechain, and TICA components. However, the constant variables (simulation setup, feature extraction details, etc.) were entirely missing.",

  "design_error_analysis": "The output omits the constant variables category, which is a crucial component of the experimental design.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The conclusion does not match the ground truth. Instead of confirming that generated trajectories have JSD values similar to the MD simulations and capturing proper dynamics, it focuses on execution difficulties and method improvements.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "The system's conclusion diverged semantically from the expected outcome, emphasizing errors and the need for methodological refinement rather than validating the experiment's success.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The ground truth experimental setup requires a two-part process: first, a simulation generation phase (loading a pre\u2010trained molecular dynamics generative model, processing input data, repeatedly rolling out trajectories, and converting them to standard molecular formats) and then an analysis phase (loading both generated and ground\u2010truth trajectories, extracting torsion angles, computing Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence metrics, performing TICA, and optionally computing decorrelation times before finally saving the analysis results). The provided diff, however, only adds a shell script that orchestrates a series of analysis commands (using scripts such as prep_sims.py, analyze_peptide_design.py, analyze_upsampling.py, apply_tica.py, and calculate_jsd.py). While the analysis phase is partially covered (for instance, TICA is applied and JSD is calculated, and results are saved by concatenating output files), the critical simulation generation steps (Steps 1\u20134) are completely missing. Moreover, the analysis commands used (for example, analyze_peptide_design.py and analyze_upsampling.py) deviate from the specified analyze_peptide_sim.py script and its required functionality (such as computing backbone and sidechain torsion angles and decorrelation times). As a result, only roughly about 3 of the 10+ steps are addressed, and even then only partially.",
  "setup_score": 30,
  "setup_error_analysis": "Missing requirements: (1) There is no evidence that the script loads a pre-trained generative model from a checkpoint (sim_inference.py functionality is not invoked), nor is there any processing of input data to extract atom positions, frames, and sequence information as required. (2) The generation of multiple trajectory rollouts conditioned on an initial frame is not executed. (3) The conversion of generated coordinates to PDB (or XTC) formats is absent. (4) The analysis script does not follow the expected pipeline in analyze_peptide_sim.py (e.g., computing torsions, decorrelation times, and performing TICA in the prescribed manner). (5) The diff shows an alternative set of analysis scripts (prep_sims.py, analyze_peptide_design.py, etc.) even though the ground truth explicitly references different functions and steps. Overall, the implementation focuses solely on post-processing and omits the core simulation generation needed to satisfy the complete ground truth requirements."
