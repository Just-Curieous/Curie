  "design": "- **Independent Variables:**\n  - Trajectory generation method: Model-generated (MDGEN) vs. Reference (ground-truth MD).\n  \n- **Dependent Variables:**\n  - Distributional similarity measured via JSD over backbone and sidechain torsion angles, and TICA components.",
  "conclusion": "The experiment's main findings underline the importance of a robust environment setup for successful execution and analysis in scientific experiments. For future endeavors:\n\n- Address and resolve environment setup issues and ensure availability of all necessary files and scripts.\n- Ensure accurate execution of model-based trajectory generation and complete analysis of distributional similarity metrics.\n- Extend experimentation to include comprehensive evaluation across different peptide environments for robust scientific conclusions."
