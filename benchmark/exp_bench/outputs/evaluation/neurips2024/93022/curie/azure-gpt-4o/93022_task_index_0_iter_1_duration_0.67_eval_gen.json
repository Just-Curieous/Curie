  "design": "- **Independent Variables**:\n  - Trajectory Generation Method: Forward simulation using MDGEN versus Reference MD trajectories.\n\n- **Dependent Variables**:\n  - Distributional Similarity Metrics: Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) calculations over backbone torsion angles, sidechain torsion angles, and top TICA components.",
  "conclusion": "The experiment encountered notable execution difficulties. Preliminary findings suggest partial alignment in distribution metrics but indicate the necessity for improved methodological precision and robust error handling. Future work should focus on verifying script efficacy, addressing current execution hurdles, and refining feature analysis for comprehensive dataset pair comparison."
