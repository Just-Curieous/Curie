  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The design output correctly identifies all key variables: the constant variables (Reference MSM and trajectory generation details), the independent variables (MDGEN model and MSMs from various durations), and the dependent variables (Path Likelihood, Fraction of Valid Paths, and JSD). It captures the essence of the experiment as described in the ground truth.",
  "design_score": 100,
  "design_error_analysis": "No critical information was omitted or misrepresented. Although additional experimental details were provided, they did not detract from correctly identifying the required variables.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The conclusion correctly reflects the ground truth by stating that MDGEN outperforms MSMs derived from shorter simulations and confirms its ability to model rare, long-timescale transitions, albeit with slightly different phrasing.",
  "conclusion_score": "correct",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "While the predicted conclusion added remarks on technical execution barriers and future work, the core semantic message matches the ground truth and no key aspects were misrepresented.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The provided setup_output is effectively empty and does not include any modifications or implementations of the required steps. None of the ground-truth requirements (from loading the pre-trained MDGEN model, reading peptide data, extracting features, building the MSM, identifying start and end states, sampling conformations, generating transition paths, saving files with metadata, to performing the subsequent analysis steps including discretization, likelihood calculations, and comparison with replicate MD simulations) can be traced in the diff. Without any changes to the source code or configuration that implement these steps, the experiment setup is entirely missing.",
  "setup_score": 0,
  "setup_error_analysis": "All the required steps outlined in the setup_ground_truth, which are demonstrated in the provided ground truth scripts for both tps_inference.py and analyze_peptide_tps.py, are absent from the setup_output. There is no evidence of loading the checkpoint, reading the peptide data, feature extraction, MSM construction, state identification, path generation, saving the generated trajectories, or any analysis as per the ground truth. As a result, none of the experimental requirements have been implemented."
