  "design_evaluation_explanation": "The design output only captured a partial independent variable (trajectory generation method) that loosely corresponds to the 'Trajectory Type' but omitted the constant variable, additional independent variables (Torsion Angle Category and Lag Time Range) and all the dependent variables described in the ground truth.",
  "design_score": 14,
  "design_error_analysis": "The output failed to include the 'Tetrapeptide trajectories simulated via all-atom explicit-solvent MD', the Torsion Angle Category and Lag Time Range, and instead of measuring relaxation times, autocorrelation profiles, and MSM flux matrix correlations, it mentioned irrelevant metrics like distributional similarity via JSD and TICA components.",
  "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "The predicted conclusion does not reflect the specific findings outlined in the ground truth concerning torsion relaxation times, autocorrelation behavior, and the MSM flux matrix correlation.",
  "conclusion_score": "incorrect",
  "conclusion_error_analysis": "Rather than addressing the experimental outcomes on sidechain and backbone torsions and detailed autocorrelation and flux matrix evaluations, the conclusion focused on generic environment setup issues and future recommendations, missing the core results.",
  "setup_evaluation_explanation": "The provided diff shows a shell script that sets up a control experiment by activating an environment and running several commands (e.g., prep_sims.py, analyze_peptide_design.py, analyze_upsampling.py, apply_tica.py, and calculate_jsd.py), followed by concatenating pickle files. However, the ground truth requires a series of specific steps related to simulation model inference (loading a pre\u2010trained checkpoint, reading a CSV of peptide sequences, loading initial structure data for each peptide, performing multiple trajectory rollouts with sim_inference.py, and saving trajectories as PDB and (optionally) XTC files) as well as a detailed analysis pipeline implemented in analyze_peptide_sim.py (including JSD computation, torsion autocorrelation, TICA, MSM building, and saving analysis results). None of the diff\u2019s commands reference sim_inference.py or the analysis steps as required by ground truth. Instead, it calls a set of entirely different scripts that do not match the detailed simulation and analysis steps specified. As a result, the setup output fails to meet most of the required step-by-step actions and configurations detailed in the ground truth.",
  "setup_score": 0,
  "setup_error_analysis": "The diff misses key requirements: it does not load the simulation model from a checkpoint, does not read the peptide sequences from a CSV file, does not load or process initial structure data for each peptide, does not run the trajectory rollout routines (generating and saving PDB/xtc files), and does not implement the expected analysis pipeline (Jensen-Shannon divergence, torsion decorrelation, TICA processing, and Markov state modeling) as laid out in analyze_peptide_sim.py. Instead, it calls different scripts that are not aligned with the ground truth specification."
