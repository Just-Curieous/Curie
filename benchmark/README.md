# Benchmark
This directory hosts a curated collection of benchmark tasks designed to demonstrate Curie's performance on various machine learning and engineering tasks. 

Contents
- **[`mle_bench`](./mle_bench/)**: A curated benchmark suite based on Kaggle competitions to assess end-to-end ML engineering skills, from OpenAI's MLE-Bench. It includes tasks in image classification, tabular data, NLP, and signal processing.
  
- `experimentation_bench/`: Tasks focusing on computer science experimentation tasks mentioned in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16069)

- `junior_ml_engineer_bench/`: Entry-level ML tasks aimed at evaluating skills in machine learning engineering.

- `junior_mlsys_engineer_bench/`: Introductory tasks tailored for those beginning in ML systems engineering.
