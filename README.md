Curie is the first AI-agent framework designed for automated and rigorous scientific experimentation. 
Curie helps answer your curiosity through end-to-end experimentation automation, ensuring that every stepâ€”from hypothesis formulation to result interpretationâ€”is conducted with precision, reliability, and reproducibility.

**Key Features**
- ðŸš€ Automated Experimentation â€“ From hypothesis formulation, experiment implementation, experiment execution, result analysis and finding reflection.
- ðŸ“Š Rigor Enhancement - Built-in verification modules enforce methodical procedure, agent reliability and reproducibility.
- ðŸ”¬ Broad Applicability â€“ Supports ML research, system analysis, and scientific discovery.
<!-- - ðŸ“– Experimentation Benchmark - Provide 46 questions from 4 Computer Science domains, based on influential papers and open-source projects (`benchmark/experimentation_bench`). -->

## [Installation](./docs/installation.md)

1. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/. 
  - Grant permission to docker via `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`. 
  - Run `docker ps` to check that permission has been granted with the Docker daemon.

2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie.git
cd Curie
```

3. Put your [LLM API credentials](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) under `curie/setup/env.sh`. Example: 

```
export MODEL="gpt-4o" 
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxx" 
```

4. Build the container image. This will take a few minutes. 
```bash
pip install -e .
docker images -q exp-agent-image | xargs -r docker rmi -f # remove any existing conflict image
cd curie && docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t exp-agent-image -f ExpDockerfile_default .. && cd -
```

## Quick Start
Use the following command to input your research question or problem statement: `python3 -m curie.main -q "<Your research question>"`.

### **Example 1**: [You Have a Single Question Needed to be Verified](./docs/quick_start.md).

Q: I want to understand the Sorting Algorithm Efficiency.

A: Simply input your question to Curie:

```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
  -q "How does the choice of sorting algorithm impact runtime performance across different \
  input distributions (random, nearly sorted, reverse sorted)?" 
```
- **Estimated runtime**: ~5 minutes
- **Auto-generated Experiment report**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/research_sorting_efficiency_20250310015235.md).
- **Curie log**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/research_sorting_efficiency_20250310015235.log)
- **Logs and Reproducibilty**:
  - Real-time logs are streamed to the console.
  - Experiment report are stored in `logs/research_<ID>.md`  
  - The full experimentation process (script to reproduce results, generated code and experiment results) is saved in `workspace/research_<ID>/`.

### Example 2: You Have a Dataset and Want to Gain Insight from It

Q: I have a dataset and some starter code,and I want to train/deloy ML models to achieve my goals

A: Simply provide your dataset, codebase and question to Curie:

```bash
python3 -m curie.main -q '[Example]: How to improve my prediction accuracy on my datastet. \
                      Checkout <paper.pdf> for the background information.' \
                      --task_config curie/configs/mle.json \
                      --dataset_dir <abs_path_to_your_dataset> \
                      --workspace_name <abs_path_to_your_codebase [optional]> 
```
