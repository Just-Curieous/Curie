Curie is the first AI-agent framework designed for automated and rigorous scientific experimentation. 
Curie helps answer your curiosity through end-to-end experimentation automation, ensuring that every stepâ€”from hypothesis formulation to result interpretationâ€”is conducted with precision, reliability, and reproducibility.

**Key Features**
- ðŸš€ Automated Experimentation â€“ End-to-end workflow management: hypothesis formulation, experiment setup, experiment execution, result analysis and finding reflection.
- ðŸ“Š Rigor Enhancement - Built-in verification modules enforce methodical procedure, reliability and interpretability.
- ðŸ”¬ Broad Applicability â€“ Supports ML research, system analysis, and scientific discovery.
- ðŸ“– Experimentation Benchmark - Provide 46 questions from 4 Computer Science domains, based on influential papers and open-source projects (`benchmark/experimentation_bench`).

## [Installation](./docs/installation.md)

1. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/. 
  - Grant permission to docker via `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`. 
  - Run `docker ps` to check that permission has been granted with the Docker daemon.

2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie.git
cd Curie
```

3. Put your LLM API credentials under `curie/setup/env.sh`. Example: 

```
export MODEL="gpt-4o" 
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxx" 
```

4. Build the container image. This will take a few minutes. Note: you may need to setup a virtual environment before running pip install.

```bash
pip install -e .
docker images -q exp-agent-image | xargs -r docker rmi -f # remove any existing conflict image
cd curie && docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t exp-agent-image -f ExpDockerfile_default .. && cd -
```

## Quick Start
Use the following command to input your research question or problem statement: `python3 -m curie.main -q "<Your research question>"`.

### **Example 1**: Understanding Sorting Algorithm Efficiency

```bash
python3 -m curie.main \
  -q "How does the choice of sorting algorithm impact runtime performance across different \
  input distributions (random, nearly sorted, reverse sorted)?" --report
```
- **Estimated runtime**: ~5 minutes
- **Sample log file**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/research_sorting_efficiency_20250310015235.log)
- **Experiment report**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/research_sorting_efficiency_20250310015235.md).
- **Logs and Reproducibilty**:
  - Real-time logs are streamed to the console.
  - Experiment logs and experiment report (`--report`) are stored in `logs/research_<ID>`  
  - The full experimentation process (code, script and real results) is saved in `workspace/research_<ID>/`.

### **Example 2**: How does the choice of activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) impact the model training convergence rate?

```bash
python3 -m curie.main -f benchmark/junior_ml_engineer_bench/q1_activation_func.txt --report
```
- **Sample log file**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/mle_activation_func_20250326.log)
- **Sample report file**: Available [here](./docs/example_logs/mle_activation_func_20250326.md)

### Example 3: General Machine Learning Questions with Your Dataset

If you have a dataset but are unsure how to start training/deloying your ML models to achieve your goals, simply provide your dataset and question to Curie:
```bash
python3 -m curie.main -q 'Example: How to improve my prediction accuracy on my datastet' \
                      --task_config curie/configs/mle.json \
                      --dataset_dir <path to your dataset> \
                      --report
```  
- You can include your own starter code by adding the argument `--workspace_name <path_to_your_workspace>`.
- Check out an [example](./benchmark/mle_bench/dog-breed-identification/) from [MLE-Bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench).
