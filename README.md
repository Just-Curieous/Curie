Curie is the first AI-agent framework designed for automated and rigorous scientific experimentation. 
Curie helps answer your curiosity through end-to-end experimentation automation, ensuring that every stepâ€”from hypothesis formulation to result interpretationâ€”is conducted with precision, reliability, and reproducibility.

*Paper describing Curie's architecture and evaluation is coming soon.*

**Key Features**
- ðŸš€ Automated Experimentation â€“ End-to-end workflow management: hypothesis formulation, experiment setup, experiment execution, result analysis and finding reflection.
- ðŸ“Š Rigor Enhancement - Built-in verification modules enforce methodical procedure, reliability and interpretability.
- ðŸ”¬ Broad Applicability â€“ Supports ML research, system analysis, and scientific discovery.
- ðŸ“– Experimentation Benchmark - Provide 46 questions from 4 Computer Science domains, based on influential papers and open-source projects (`benchmark/experimentation_bench`).

## Installation

1. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/. 
Grant permission to docker via `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`. Run `docker ps` to check the permission with the Docker daemon.

2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie.git
cd Curie
```

3. Put your LLM API credentials under `curie/setup/env.sh`. Example: 

```
export MODEL="azure/gpt-4o"
export AZURE_API_VERSION="2024-06-01"
export AZURE_API_KEY="your-key"
export ORGANIZATION='your-org'
export AZURE_API_BASE='your-base'
```

4. Build the container image. This will take a few minutes. Note: you may need to setup a virtual environment before running pip install.

```bash
pip install -e .
cd curie && sudo docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t exp-agent-image -f ExpDockerfile_default .. && cd -
```

## Quick Start

1. Input your research question or problem statement (expected processing time: 5-10 minutes).
```bash
python3 -m curie.main -q "How does the choice of sorting algorithm impact runtime performance across different input distributions (random, nearly sorted, reverse sorted)?" --task_config curie/configs/base_config.json
```
OR
```bash
python3 -m curie.main -q "At what array size does parallel sorting outperform single-threaded sorting?" --task_config curie/configs/base_config.json
```

- While the logs are continuously streamed, you can also check the logs at `logs/research_question_<ID>.log`.

- You can check the reproducible experimentation process under `workspace/research_<ID>/`.

## Tutorial
- [How to reproduce the results in `Large Language Monkeys'. ](./docs/tutorial-large-language-monkey.md)


## Use Cases
Curie is designed for scientific discovery across multiple domains:

  - [How does repeated sampling in LLM inference affect the quality of response?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787)
- ðŸ’» System Performance Analysis â€“ Benchmarking systems, optimizing configurations, investigating system trade-offs.
  - [What configurations affects the energy consumption of LLM serving?](https://ml.energy/leaderboard/?__theme=light)
  - [How does the request bursty arrival pattern affects the user experience in LLM serving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16283)
- ðŸ§ª Algorithmic & Scientific Discovery â€“ Validating hypotheses, automating computational simulations.

## Customize Your Experimentation Agents

Config `curie/configs/base_config.json`.
- You can add your domain-specific instructions for the supervisor by customizing `supervisor_system_prompt_filename` and worker `control_worker_system_prompt_filename`
